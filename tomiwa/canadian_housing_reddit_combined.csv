This NDP response to the housing crisis is pretty impressive. I'm glad they're sharing real actionable steps they will take to address the crisis.


Edit: Just a note - if you like this policy and have Twitter, make sure to engage with their Tweet (like or retweet) so the NDP know this policy is popular and a vote winner",CanadaHousing,2021-07-08 20:21:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/ogecv9/jagmeet_singhs_plan_invest_in_building_500000/,1842
"Canada economy in decline trying to save housing prices, Cyclical cycle","To me Canadian economy should be so vibrant and strong, yet it is not performing well compared to boomers time. Canada has the best resources, market and stable politics and finance. 

The reason I believe Canada is lacking behind is because Housing became such a good investment tool for citizens and corporates. ROI became ridiculous and instead of investing to future, people invested in housing. Ofc this is good for short term economy boom, but now I think the society is paying it's price. 

Isn't it simple? Housing return is good >> higher mortgage, higher rent, people have less disposable income to spend on goods >> companies invest less on production due to low spending power >> people wages stagnate due to companies not making much money >> government cannot crash housing because that's where money is invested in >>  government tries to make debt easier so people can spend more money >> weaker currency, people spend more money on housing >> lower purchasing power >> companies invest less >> etc etc.  

I believe Canada is not doomed or anything, in fact it is doing pretty well compared to other countries except USA. If Canada can increase its wages and flat out the housing prices for decades, I think wages can catch up and hopefully the government have learned the lesson for the past decades not to go for short term real estate gains and invest in people and production for healthier economy. Canada GDP right now is just too dependent on Real estate value, and hopefully we can lower the portion of pie by increasing productivity rather than decreasing overall GDP/capita. 

My suggestions: 

1. Canada has many rural areas that people are leaving, move high paying jobs and try to incentivize businesses to move to those livable areas, if wages are high and got good school, hospital people will start to move. That's how the cities grow, by having companies and capital being invested. This will lower housing price on currently big cities. This is global issue, politicians want densifications for economies of scales because they probably own multiple houses in those areas, but then those major cities just absorb all the real estate frenzy and abandon smaller cities because everything is invested into the major cities. You need to spread out people and make sure you maintain relatively healthier size cities than uncontrollable mega cities where micro units go for 500k. Housing value will spread out and really help affordability issue. People will not look housing as great investment. Moving jobs is challenging but with great tax incentive and government support wages or even free housing (or whatever creative policies) to get young families move I think this method is best and healthier. 

2. Too many green zones even in Urban areas right now, try to work with aboriginal people and build more housing, increase supplies.

3. For short term, maybe setup different tax bracket for people who have SFH vs Multiunit lots. I think SFH tax in cities like Vancouver is too low. I think taxes should be at least same as Alberta for SFH so we collect more from people who are using more land & resources. I really don't like this idea but for short term it might be good to have more supplies converted into condos/townhouses. 

4. Federal, stop tackling demand side, government is trying it's best to inflate the price. Giving tax free for first time home buyer, increasing mortgage to 30years, lowering down payment requirement etc. I see that government wants debt to continue to support economy, but I don't think this is healthy.

Unpopular opinion - housing should not be an investment,"***reposting as I posted in the wrong subreddit***

Hear me out. I'm a second generation Canadian and all of my family members own their own houses and some have an additional rental property. My parents bought their first house in the 70s for I think $40k. They still own the house and worth around $2M now.

I have no idea how things got this bad this fast in our country, but something has to change before it gets even worse. Ridiculous rents and ridiculous house prices. 

Should house prices be set so they won't go up or go down? I'm my opinion a house should be a tool that is used to LIVE in and to raise a family. That's it. 

Our current house we bought in 2015 was bought for around $500k. Currently valued around $1M. Should it be worth $1M, no it should probably be what we paid for. 

No politician will ever mention this because it is political suicide. But I don't really know what the solution is. We have too many people coming into the country and not enough houses and we are not building enough. The solution from them is let's convert current homes to four plex houses and rent it all out. 

Just a mini rant but I really don't know how this country doesn't go further in the toilet than it has.",CanadaHousing,2023-07-20 15:58:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/154t9qv/unpopular_opinion_housing_should_not_be_an/,504
People really aren't angry enough about economic inequality,"I have a similar job in terms of pay grade to what my grandfather had at my age. The difference in what that job affords us is quite stark.

I get I have a massive amount of student debt compared to what he had, but let's ignore that because the cashflow shouldn't be that severely impacted by a single debt.

At my age, he had a used prop plane, a mortgage on a reasonably large home on a large property, multiple watercraft, vehicle, a wife and kids (where the wife's job did not fully offset the cost of raising kids), the ability to travel frequently, and there's bound to be things I'm not aware of because he passed without me being able to ask.

Contrast myself, where I'm saving as much as I can by not moving out of student housing, and housing plus student debt eats up more than half of my post tax income. If I moved into a 1 bedroom apartment, I literally could not afford to feed myself and commute to work.

Supply is half the equation, the other half is that incomes have not kept up with the cost of living.

&#x200B;

The silver lining for me is that I'm in a position where there is a ladder for me to climb, opportunities to do so, and the education my coworkers don't have which is legally required to climb in my industry. In 5-10 years, I might not be as squeezed, but in the meantime, its a real struggle and I'm not able to put away the level of savings I really should be able to. Savings not to afford a house, savings to survive a Covid level crisis.

&#x200B;

Let's forget about ownership for a minute, and just straight up consider the core problem facing both primary residence ownership and renting a primary residence. We have two problems, a lack of supply driving costs up, and inflation on all the consumer pricing indexes outstripping wage increases by a large margin.

&#x200B;

I don't think it is enough to simply tackle the supply issue without also addressing the elephant in the room of economic inequality being at the highest it has been in the last hundred years.",CanadaHousing,2021-06-20 13:47:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/o44yx2/people_really_arent_angry_enough_about_economic/,782
Why you should care about housing affordability in Canada if you are a homeowner (even a selfish one),"**TLDR – High housing costs will get passed onto the general public in the longer term either directly through increased prices for goods and services, increased taxes, and/or the degradation of the quality of living in Canada due to lack of workers available to provide goods/services. Either scenario will stifle future economic growth as well as decrease the desirability of living in Canada in various ways. The issue will eventually come full circle with high housing prices being the root cause of a future decline in demand for Canadian real estate, and therefore, a decline in value/price of Canadian real estate.**

It’s common knowledge that the majority of Canadians are homeowners and therefore, the recent escalation of real estate prices across the country has increased the wealth of the majority of Canadians. As a result, many people may come to the conclusion that the escalation of Canadian real estate prices is a good thing for Canada as a whole as it increases the collective wealth of its citizens. Although I understand why your average Canadian homeowner might think this, I think it is short sighted and ignores the bigger picture negative impact that unaffordable home prices will have on the country as a whole over the longer term (future decades).  

Some existing homeowners (myself included) do care about the general wellbeing of Canadians and want housing to be affordable for everyone even if that means a reduction in the value of their own home. However, my impression is that this group is a small minority. Obviously it’s not hard to understand why a large portion of the home owning population would want to maintain or increase the value of their home as there is an obvious immediate personal benefit. The bigger picture negative consequences are much less obvious and will play out slowly but surely over a much longer period of time. It’s not surprising that your average person would much more enticed by the immediate benefits while ignoring (or being oblivious to) the longer term costs. However, I would argue that those longer term costs outweigh the immediate benefits for the vast majority of the home owning population as I think unaffordable housing poses an existential threat to the future of Canada if it isn’t addressed in a meaningful way in the not too distant future. The issue is most apparent in Toronto and Vancouver but it pretty much applies across the country to varying extents. What I describe below is most applicable to Vancouver and Toronto but also applies to the remainder of the country, although to a lesser extent.

The primary reason why existing homeowners should care about housing affordability is that the high cost of housing will personally impact them, both financially and non-financially over the long run. The reason for this is - in order to function properly, a city/region needs a substantial amount of people who work jobs that don’t pay significant wages (the “working class”) but are critical for it to function properly. For example – teachers, nurses, paramedics, firefighters, police, construction workers, garbage collection workers, infrastructure maintenance workers, bus drivers, farm workers (and everyone else involved in the food supply chain), restaurant workers, retail workers, truck drivers, and so on. So what happens when wages for these jobs are so disconnected from the local cost of housing that these types of people simply just can’t find a place that they can afford to live in? There are two primary consequences:

1. Significant reduction in the workforce - People will leave and move to a place where the wage they earn in that new location will allow them to afford a place to live there.
2. Wage increases - For those who choose to remain in HCOL areas, wages will increase to a level where these workers can afford to live there.

These consequences will not be fully felt immediately, but rather, will become increasingly pronounced as time goes on. The likely result will be a combination of the two – some people will leave and will move to a place where they can afford to live and the people who stay will see their wages rise. We have already started to experience these effects but we are still in the beginning stages of what will become a much more significant issue further down the road. So why should a homeowner care about this (even if they are selfish and are only worried about their own needs)? Canadians as a whole will ultimately bear the cost because:

1. Significant reduction in the workforce
   1. If there aren’t enough people to staff all the critical working class jobs in a city, this will decrease the availability and quality of goods and services available in the region. A prime example of this is the current doctor shortage in Canada – look at the portion of the population that doesn’t have a GP and has to rely on walk-in clinics or going to the ER. Look at how long it takes to get an MRI or an appointment at a specialist (often over a year). Or imagine needing an ambulance only to find out that paramedics are understaffed and you aren’t their top priority. The general degradation of services in HCOL areas will obviously negatively impact local residents, which includes wealthy homeowners.
   2. Without an adequate local workforce, businesses will shut down or move to a location where they have a better labour pool. People will also be resistant to starting new businesses since they know they will have significant challenges with labour availability and cost. This will further weaken our already struggling economy.
   3. Another less obvious way that the workforce will decline in the longer term is that younger people will stop having kids. The birth rate in Canada is already very low and will continue to decline as young people can barely afford to get by themselves, let alone being able to afford children.

1. Wage increases
   1. In order for most businesses to be able to raise the wages of their employees, they must raise their prices, which ultimately just passes on the additional cost to the consumer. There seems to be a common misconception that businesses in general have huge profits and could simply just afford to increase wages to whatever level necessary. While this is true with certain highly profitable businesses/industries, it does not apply to the vast majority of businesses. I’m an accountant so I’ve gotten to see “behind the curtains” of many different businesses and you’d be surprised how many just breakeven or have a small profit/loss. Those types of businesses are much more common than the ones that are wildly profitable. This is due to basic economic forces – if a certain business/industry is making huge profits, that entices others to enter the industry, increasing competition, which decreases profits. Restaurants are a prime example of an industry with low margins as there are low barriers to entry – many have gone out of business in the recent years and think about how expensive that continue to operate have gotten, and how everyone is asking for 20%+ tips now as the norm. There’s a reduction in supply accompanied by an increase in cost.
   2. Any government related service, the general public will ultimately bear the increased cost via higher taxes. If we pay teachers, nurses, firefighters, police, city maintenance workers, public transit workers, etc. enough that they can afford to like in a HCOL city, that’s going to basically double all of their salaries.  Their increased salaries will ultimately be paid by the general public via increased taxes. Canada already has high enough taxes so raising them even further with have negative impacts that directly impact individuals and also have a broader negative impact on the economy.  

In short, further down the road you either won’t be able to order a pizza because there won’t be any people here to make it for you, or you’ll need to pay $75 for your pizza because the pizza shop needs to pay their employees $40/hour so that they can afford to live in the area. There will be less goods/services available and what’s available will cost significantly more. In summary, either Canadian society will fail to function properly because it won’t have workers to provide the essential goods and services or it will continue to function properly but with greatly increased costs. Obviously neither is a desirable outcome. Realistically, the result will be somewhere in the middle – a decline in the quality of goods and services accompanied by an increase in price.

Another major factor is that the divide between the rich and the poor will continue to increase, leading to social unrest. This is something that we’ve already started to see with crime increasing – look at all the stolen car stuff you see on the news from the GTA. IMO, part of what made Canada a great country in the past is that there wasn’t that big of difference between the rich and the poor. Most people were more or less in the same boat financially and this leads to a very peaceful society with low crime because the vast majority of the population has their basic needs taken care of and people aren’t acting out of desperation. Wealth inequality is a big risk that leads to social unrest and can destabilize what used to be a peaceful society. Brazil is a prime example of a country that is very dangerous because there is a big difference between the haves and the have nots. Historically this has also been a big difference between Canada and the US – the US has always had greater wealth inequality than Canada and has much greater crime as a result.

If Canadian society continues to head towards this downward spiral, what do you think will happen to the demand for people to live in Canada, and therefore, the demand for Canadian real estate? Ironically, the issue of unaffordable housing will eventually come full circle as high housing prices will eventually be the main cause of a reduction in housing prices further down the road.

Here are some preemptive responses to common rebuttals that I am sure some people will bring up in the comments:

* “There are plenty of super expensive cities in the world that operate totally fine. The lower class workers just commute into town from the surrounding areas that are more affordable.” - Using Vancouver (where I live) as an example as the issue is most acute here (with Toronto being a close second) – Vancouver is unique from most other expensive cities in that the surrounding suburbs are still very expensive and we also don’t have sufficient infrastructure (roads & public transportation) to efficiently move large amounts of people from the surrounding areas to their jobs in the city. NYC for example – the prime areas are way more expensive than Toronto or Vancouver but the metro region is huge and there are drastically cheaper areas that are a relatively short train ride away. If you don’t believe me, look up real estate prices in Yonkers, Queens, The Bronx, Jersey City, Newark, etc. In Vancouver, a half decent house in the core goes for like $2.5M but for some reason a house an hour away in Langley is still $1.5M and two hours away in Chilliwack it’s still $1M. And there isn’t even sufficient public transit to efficiently get you into your Vancouver job from those places anyways. So where the heck is someone who works at a coffee shop in downtown Vancouver supposed to live?  
* “We’ll keep importing cheap foreign labour” - I think it’s pretty clear by now that this strategy that Canada has been using has significant negative consequences and is not sustainable. In addition to the various negative impacts that Canadians have felt, the foreign workers themselves won’t want to come here anymore as their standard of living in far below what it used to be.
* “Canada is very desirable and wealthy people will always want to live here” – This has been the case in Canada historically, however, I would argue that a significant factor that many people don’t realize about is that high housing prices also impact high earners as well. Imagine a young person in med school – yes, they can afford a detached house in Vancouver but did they really go to med school so that they can eventually afford to buy a $2M old bungalow? At every price level, what you get for that price level sucks.
* “They won’t be able to buy but they can just rent for life” – Although I mostly refer to buying a house/condo, what I am saying applies to both renting and buying. Obviously there is a close correlation between buying costs and renting costs, as they are essentially substitutes for each other and the landlords who own the rental properties are looking to recover the high cost that they paid to buy the rental property. You can’t have really expensive real estate to buy and also have cheap rent in the same market – that just doesn’t make sense. Renting has historically been cheaper than buying but current rent prices are still very high and disconnected from local incomes.
* “Most young people are going to inherit a bunch of money from their wealthy homeowning parents” – Firstly, although there are a considerable amount of rich baby boomers who will pass their wealth down to their kids, this is still a relative small privileged group in the grand scheme of the country. More importantly – even if people have rich parents, inheritance usually comes later in life, not at the age when you really need it where you are buying your first home and trying to start a family. The average life expectancy in Canada is around 80, so most people will receive their inheritance when their parents die and they are in their 60’s. You don’t need a bunch of money to buy a house when you are 60 – you need it when you are 30.

Housing in the Netherlands,"I see plenty of people in this sub worried about how the Canadian government is trying to get into the business of building rentals but this is the solution we need. 

So housing in the Netherlands is crazy expensive. By the end of 2024, the average home price hit around €500k For most folks, buying a place is just not realistic. But here’s the thing, a lot of people get by just fine because of the country’s strong social housing system. About 1/3 of all homes are owned by the housing associations and rented out at affordable rates. Even with rent hikes in 2024, social housing rents only went up by about 5 percent. So, while the housing market is wild, many people can still find a decent place to live without going broke. These units in Amsterdam can go for €700 for a 1-2 bedroom apartment, which scales with income. 

People still want to buy a home can still buy a home but others can get by just renting and know there are options available and are not worried about eviction due to strong tenant rights in their country. They also won’t have to worry about all the problems that come with home ownership. 

This is the goal we should have in Canada, housing prices need to go down but having secure affordable housing is a great start and hopefully all the extra supply and reduced demand will decrease the price of housing.

At what level of extremity does the housing crisis need to reach for the government to act?,"Across Canada it now takes [67% of the median income](https://www.nbc.ca/content/dam/bnc/taux-analyses/analyse-eco/logement/housing-affordability.pdf) to afford the median home, a four decade high. This number needs to be around 30-40%.

In the Greater Toronto Area and Lower Mainland you need to earn higher than a top 3% household income to afford the median home if you do not have hundreds of thousands of dollars. ""[Lying flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping)"" now seems inevitable for Canadian youth without massive early inheritances.

This housing crisis is getting to comical levels yet the federal, provincial, and municipal governments are pissing in the wind with their housing policies. And no, you cannot sprawl your way out of a crisis this extreme. Most millennials (and maybe Gen Z too) will be well past child bearing age by the time any real impact could be felt. What a disaster.

The course we're on as a country is obviously unsustainable, especially when considering our reliance on population growth to pay for CPP and social safety net obligations. Who is going to move to a place where subsistence level living requires earning more than the median income?

We're experiencing the simultaneous failure of several government institutions - every level of government, the Bank of Canada, OSFI, etc. All of them have prioritized their own housing gains over the stability of the country. They are all full of people that believe they're investing geniuses when most of the gains were a result of rent-seeking (NIMBYism, endlessly adding new requirements, long delays, etc.) and cruel laws (outright banning the only types of shelter that people can afford) allowing people to be price gouged just to get basic shelter.

**At what point will there be political will to try to fix the crisis?** Do we need to see net emigration? Mass homelessness? Collapsing GDP? Apparently a 40 year high in unaffordability is not enough.

Not one meaningful housing policy from any level of government affecting southern Ontario, LM, Montreal, Halifax, or PEI so far. Yikes.",CanadaHousing,2023-01-16 06:14:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/10d5w1v/at_what_level_of_extremity_does_the_housing/,355
Things don't have to be like this,"I come from a country that some nice Canadians would label as 3rd world out of ignorance (Nothing makes me smile more than reading folks here asking : Are we becoming a 3rd world country ? completely oblivious to the fact that the world has moved on and some of those countries they think of have dwarfed Canada in any human development indicator)...

The reality is that, besides most problems I've encountered here : The lack of transportation, food prices, decaying infrastructure, the state of education and healthcare, the expectation to save for retirement while you are spending most of your time working for an employer who makes millions on your back (No it's not normal in most places : I work for you, YOU pay my pension), the rule of renegotiating rates every 5 years to keep you stressed (talking about a robust banking system, any banking system would be robust if it was allowed to brutally push risk to the customer side lol), and the list goes on.

Anyways, something peculiar attracted my attention about housing : Where I come from, there is no crisis, even though the climate, the proximity to Europe (and the underlying foreign demand), the quality of construction, the modern public transportation network, all signal more reason for prices to be higher, way higher...but they are not. One of the main reasons, is that the gov't heavily funded a state company that acts directly as a player in the residential construction market, They build massive social housing with acceptable quality and dimensions and fixed prices, that the poor and the young can afford. They also constrain the buyers to exploit the house (companies are excluded, individuals can buy only 1, renting or selling are banned for 5 years, then you do as you like). And they actively make sure that supply is often higher than demand by providing actual incentives to private construction companies (20% of the cost is covered by a dedicated fund). The state also designed partnerships with banks to make sure that interest rates are quite low if you qualify as a low income. That way, the poor can ALWAYS afford a home, and there is no ""unnatural"" competition among buyers : Like if I make 250k$ alone, and want to negotiate a good unit, why should I worry about a couple that makes 150K$ both and who are ready to sell their soul to the bank to overbid and present a crazy counter offer ?! how is that good for anyone ? especially THEM ?! My conclusion, is that the federal and provincial gov'ts here are conspiring against people, and everything about the current situation is manufactured and intended to inflict a unique form of mental violence on the average guy. It's disgusting. And it will end badly...

Edit : After the reactions, I just want to congratulate everyone for being so openminded. I also am starting to believe that there is no issue here...it's all a perception. people are good with whatever is going on ! I wish you all...more of it.",CanadaHousing,2024-04-09 15:32:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/1bztnhd/things_dont_have_to_be_like_this/,236
Housing should be for NON-PROFIT,"Housing, which is a basic need thus has inelasticity of demand, is horrifying when left to the free market and leads to corrupting our government towards pro real estate investor policies (as we see today) at the expense of renters who work 9-5 just to have most of it go to rent.   


Housing can be easily abused for profit and rent price inflated astronomically high since: 1. no one wants to be homeless 2. there is very limited supply. these two reasons are why real estate is very attractive to investors as it is known to be low risk and steady flow of passive income, which sometimes takes up to 50-60% out of worker's pay check [https://rentpanda.ca/rent-report-october-2022](https://rentpanda.ca/rent-report-october-2022)

leaving more and more people priced out of their homes and increasing the homeless population  (which no one wants in our community, and no its not bc they arent working hard enough) while normalizing smaller appartments/houses, and more expensive rent, or even glorify homelessness like living in an RV. This trend is dangerous to the economic productivity and happiness index, as removing the ability to climb the social ladder (As wealth inequality grows) disencourages workers, leaving more and more to give up and be homeless, or just make enough to survive. Nordic countries have many programs that redistribute wealth and fund essential social programs to support the less fortunate instead of barring them from opportunities in education, housing, and careers, thus resulting in the highest and most consistent happiness index in the world as well as the most billionaires per capita (this is possible bc unlike one billionaire that has 18 billion dollars, they have 18 billionairs that each have around 1 billion dollars. and a billion is wayy more than enough for 454 people to live off of for a lifetime [https://www.planeasy.ca/how-much-money-will-flow-through-our-hands-over-a-lifetime/#:\~:text=Given%20that%20the%20average%20person,to%20manage%20income%20and%20spending](https://www.planeasy.ca/how-much-money-will-flow-through-our-hands-over-a-lifetime/#:~:text=Given%20that%20the%20average%20person,to%20manage%20income%20and%20spending).)

  
the housing crisis is caused by a very limited supply of housing, of which is caused by landlords in government. this is explained simply through demand and supply in relation to value. the less supply and the more demand something is, the more valuable it is. and thus government officials who are landlords or have real estate investors in their back pockets share the same interests as all landlords and investors in canada. bc the cheapest and easiest way to increase profit in their investments without having to invest in more properties is to limit supply. the less uncompetitive the market is for investors, the more value their properties have. and unfortunately the real estate market provides the highest GDP in canadian economy which is why our main political parties do not choose to fix it, which just goes to show that there are 2 ways of making money, either you milk as much money out of something people need desperately, or you actually make something good that people actually enjoy. unfortunely our economy chose the first option. Not to butter up China, but they build 15 million new houses a year which is QUINTUPLE the amount north america AND europe COMBINED. sure u can argue that their houses are shit, but we could build 7million good quality houses instead of 15m bad ones.

"Gen Z/Younger Millenials, have you given up on Canada?","Housing is now at the point where people our age (I'm 23) will never be able to afford a house. If you want to live in a city I don't even see how you can even save up for a downpayment on studio apartment while paying current rent prices. And even if you're able to get a mortgage, you'll be a wage slave till you die.

Older Canadians have no interest in creating an affordable housing market because it'd mean their homes from 20+ years ago would decrease from 300%+ paper gains to 200% paper gains. No party (yes, even NDP) will take drastic enough measures to create affordable housing. It'd be political suicide given the homeownership rate is \~70%. This problem isn't going to get fixed anytime soon given our growing population and lackluster housing unit construction rate. Our GDP is built off pimping out shelter to one another. 

Housing in the U.S costs a fraction of what it is here, especially if you want to live in a city. Salary for skilled labor in the U.S is significantly higher, taxes are lower, and you have more career and entrepreneurial opportunities. All Canada has to offer in return is cold weather and free healthcare (no vision or dental), which you'd have anyways in the U.S at any decent employer. Am I crazy or are there really no pros to being a Canadian anymore? If you don't have generational wealth your options are being a serf for life to own a home in some desolate, cold, boring suburb, or being a serf for life in to rent a 500-600sqft shoebox apartment. I really have no hope in Canadians to fix the state of the market and want to start a life in the U.S but it's difficult moving south and buying a home with no clear path to PR.

"Limit housing ownership to 1 per person, and why commodification lead to an inevitable housing crisis","The current housing crisis is the inevitable result of commodification, which lead to toronto being the largest real estate market in the whole country. due to the inelastic demand of basic need of having a roof over your head, investors and landlords are able to exploit that to inflate housing price in hopes of making passive income at the expense of tenants whose living pay check to pay check. We are gradually transitioning into a neo-feudalist system as purchasing a house solely with one's own labour has become increasingly impossible, and only achievable if born into enough wealth. Limiting housing ownership to 1 per person prioritizes the function of housing for those in need rather than it being an investment opportunity. While any leftover housing should be publically owned and rented out to people who want temporary residence such as students or tourists at the expense rate (damages that arent wear and tear, electricity bill, etc).

&#x200B;

The inflated housing price more caused by continued privatization rather than demand and supply, while also the rising interest rates incentivizes landlords to offset the burden of their mortgages off to tenants (afterall, why would people invest if they are going to lose money for 10-20 years?). The supply of housing in toronto is not the problem, as ""Toronto real estate is the largest market, so it doesn’t surprise that it has the most vacant homes. There were 131,730 vacant homes in 2021, up a whopping 32.75% from the 2016 Census. "" [https://betterdwelling.com/new-data-shows-canada-still-has-1-3-million-vacant-homes-some-improvements-seen/](https://betterdwelling.com/new-data-shows-canada-still-has-1-3-million-vacant-homes-some-improvements-seen/)  increasing vacancy with increasing price is incompatible with demand and supply theory. While increasing interest rates of mortgages are parallel to the increase in rent cost as periods of low interest rates garnered steady rates [https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&GeographyId=2270&GeographyTypeId=3&DisplayAs=Table&GeograghyName=Toronto](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/Table?TableId=2.2.11&GeographyId=2270&GeographyTypeId=3&DisplayAs=Table&GeograghyName=Toronto) Though, interest rates increased drastically increase in early 2022, which caused the rent increase guideline to escalate from 1.2% in 2022 to 2.5% in 2023. As a result of landowners offsetting mortgage cost on tenants, basically makign tenants pay for their mortgages.

&#x200B;

Some may argue that the real estate market is critical to Canada's GDP. Sure, we can continue privatization of the market and extract as much money from real estate, but that is at the expense of tenants and only profits owners. The function of the economy is to prosper the people by efficiently distributing goods to those who need, not centralize as much wealth into as little hands as possible by exploiting the bottom line. We see this in American private healthcare, as "" U.S. health care spending grew 2.7 percent in 2021, reaching $4.3 trillion or $12,914 per person. ""[https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet#:\~:text=NHE%20grew%202.7%25%20to%20%244.3,Gross%20Domestic%20Product%20(GDP)](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet#:~:text=NHE%20grew%202.7%25%20to%20%244.3,Gross%20Domestic%20Product%20(GDP)).  while canadian public healthcare it costs $7,507 per person. The inflated healthcare cost is caused by a profit-run industry on an inherent need. As an american's healthcare plan quality is based on wealth, provided by an insurance corporation that needs its consumers to pay the extra cut of profit to run. By nationalizing our healthcare industry (championed by Socialist politician Tommy Douglas was the force behind Canada's first universal health insurance plan, enacted in Saskatchewan in *1962*. ) the cost of healthcare is not a competiton for profit, but rather people just pay for the expense.

&#x200B;

In order to limit housing to 1 per person, tenants under a specific income bracket should be able to buy off the appartment they live in at very a cheap rate. This is not a new concept as ""The Housing Act 1980"" under Margret Thatcher ""gave five million council house tenants in England and Wales the Right to Buy"" the public housing they lived in (though Thatcher destroyed public housing and created short term economic benefit at the expense of creating a housing crisis long term). The privatization of Thatchers policies was detrimental as 1/3 of ex-council homes are owned by wealthy landlords and continues to exploit public assets. while rents soared in investor-owned ex-council flats, by 2013, some tenants who had purchased their council flats, sold them later to speculators, investors or property companies. By 2013, a one-bedroom council flat that sold for £50,000 in the early 1990s, for example, had a market price of £250,000.

The GTA housing crisis is now entering catastrophe phase,"Up until a few days ago there was some hope that prices would decline enough to restore affordability. Maybe, just maybe, the supply shortage in the GTA was not as bad as feared and the price of the median home would drop enough to restore affordability to roughly 40 or 45% of median pre-tax household income ($100,000). It now appears that the correction experienced so far was just a discount rate based correction and not a bubble popping based on the rebound of several publicly traded real estate securities and the GTA market. Some people misinterpret the correction as meaning there was no supply shortage, but this conclusion does not hold up in the GTA. Median affordability WAS improving after hitting 78% in February 2022. In December 2022 it was 70% and this month it's ticking back up to 71%.

Put it together. When spending 71% on shelter, 22% on taxes, 15% on food, 10% on transportation, **the median household in the GTA needs to spend 118% of income on basic subsistence level living.** This has been true for about a year.

Read that again.

Now think about the bottom 20% of households.

The GTA is WILDLY unstable right now because of the acute housing shortage [1] that has accumulated since 2016 and earlier to the point where it's transitioning from housing crisis to housing catastrophe. Random people are getting shivved on the TTC daily, homeless population is skyrocketing, food bank usage is skyrocketing, tweakers everywhere, rents increasing 20%+ per year. All of this is happening with unemployment near record lows, real GDP growing, and inflation supposedly running at 2-4%. The only explanation left is that the housing shortage is a major cause. Previous plans to solve the shortage over a decade are simply 10x too long when there are already extremely worrying signs that the GTA is descending into chaos. Notice that London and Ottawa prices and affordability are correcting as expected because housing starts increased by over 50% when prices spiked.

Massive amounts of new homes or homes freed up by people moving in together is the **only** way to save the way of life of the GTA, home to 7 million people.

To solve the shortage and meet ongoing demand for the next 2 years, **the rate of building in the GTA needs to increase by more than a factor of 4 to about 150-200k starts/year. And those homes need to cost around $400k each at most to be affordable to the typical working family**. Another option is to eliminate moving costs as much as possible so people can move to a right-sized home if they want. Many municipal laws will need to be overruled to allow this scale of building.

Plans already in place to allow single detached homes to be converted to 3-plexes are nowhere near the scale required to solve the shortage unless 1/4 of all detached homes in the GTA are converted every year, neither plausible nor efficient.

Canada cannot afford to lose the GTA. **Relieving the GTA housing shortage needs to be treated as a national emergency to be solved in 1 or 2 years at most.**

[1] There's no question that there is an acute [housing shortage](https://old.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/10ln954/a_graph_and_question_for_the_housing_crisis/). Housing starts in the GTA were 45000 in 2022 vs 42000 in 2015, but since then we've had two periods of over 30% year over year price gains along with high population growth. Contrast this with Ottawa starts at 11000 in 2022 vs 5000 in 2015 after a 30% year over year gain. Starts in every other region in Canada increase when prices rise by a material amount, but in the GTA higher prices are not driving much more supply. The GTA has been underbuilding by at least 30000 units per year for the past 6 years. You can arrive at the same supply shortage conclusion by look at population growth instead of price increases. Adjusted for population, the GTA builds new units at about half the rate of other Canadian cities when prices rise quickly.

tl;dr: The housing shortage (not interest rates, not construction costs, not FOMO, not empty homes, etc.) now appears to be the main cause of critically unaffordable shelter costs in the GTA. Subsistence level living costs 120% of median household income and if the price correction is truly over, then this is the floor. This extreme financial pressure is causing the GTA to become WILDLY unstable. Relieving the GTA housing shortage is a national emergency.",CanadaHousing,2023-01-27 09:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/10mfyrg/the_gta_housing_crisis_is_now_entering/,251
"China’s millionaires are making housing rates in Canada, Australia and New Zealand go through the roof as Xi Jinping cracks down on private sector","[https://tfiglobalnews.com/2021/06/05/chinas-millionaires-are-making-housing-rates-in-canada-australia-and-new-zealand-go-through-the-roof-as-jinping-cracks-down-on-private-sector/](https://tfiglobalnews.com/2021/06/05/chinas-millionaires-are-making-housing-rates-in-canada-australia-and-new-zealand-go-through-the-roof-as-jinping-cracks-down-on-private-sector/)

**""** The Canadian Prime Minister added he was looking at ways to address housing [affordability](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/06/canada-housing-rising-rent-real-estate-property-market-bubble-landlords-investment), including federal funding for municipalities. **But what has caused this soar in real estate prices in Canada**? **The sole reason why property rates have been skyrocketing is that Chinese millionaires and investors want to secure a second home for themselves outside mainland China**. **The demand for luxury homes among Chinese bigwigs is so prominent that Canada’s real estate has been booming solely because of it.**

But Canada is not alone. In fact, Chinese millionaires and investors – mostly associated with the private sector are hunting for properties across the world. Under Xi Jinping’s rule in [China](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/3016074/unimpeachable-study-calls-foreign-ownership-primary-culprit), the private sector has come under an unprecedented attack. The business sentiment in the mainland is very negative and clouded by uncertainty, with Chinese company executives fearing for their fortunes. Xi Jinping’s CCP might begin an unprecedented crackdown against the private sector at any time of their choosing, so company executives and investors want to be prepared.

Interestingly, such Chinese buyers get hold of properties abroad but do not live in them. It is almost as if such properties are the ultimate safe haven of such buyers – who will shift from mainland China into them only when it becomes an absolute necessity. Therefore, according to a 2019 study by Josh Gordon, an assistant professor at Simon Fraser University’s school of public policy, the [correlation](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/money-wealth/article/3016074/unimpeachable-study-calls-foreign-ownership-primary-culprit) between house-price unaffordability and non-resident ownership rates across 14 Vancouver municipalities was found to be a staggering 96 per cent.

Chinese non-resident buyers are not just driving property prices to the sky in Canada. In fact, in Australia, Chinese buyers are returning to drive Australia’s housing [prices](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9628157/Cashed-Chinese-buyers-swarm-Australias-housing-market-buyers-rocketing-50-cent.html) up with an influx of enquiries for properties. Interest in real estate from [China](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/china/index.html) has skyrocketed by 51 per cent over the past year, according to a study by Chinese investment website Juwai. Recent tensions between China and Australia, however, have dampened the impetus which real estate prices in Australia received.

In neighbouring New Zealand, despite a ban on foreign non-resident real estate buyers, the number of [enquiries](https://list.juwai.com/news/2020/01/chinese-show-interest-new-zealand-properties-despite-ban) for the first three quarters of 2019 had shown an increase of 14 per cent compared to the same period in 2018. New Zealand interestingly, is among those countries which have banned the sale of properties to buyers who do not live in them. The aim was to make residential properties more affordable to locals as the government blamed foreign buyers for driving up home prices beyond the reach of locals.

However, Chinese buyers are still making use of some loopholes to buy properties in New Zealand. This shows their desperation to have a house outside China, just in case the CCP decides to hunt them down in the mainland.

It is human nature for people with families to try and secure themselves from incarceration – which seems to be an inevitable fate for private enterprise in China for as long as the CCP rules the mainland. However, in achieving that housing security, rich Chinese buyers are driving up real estate prices in countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, resulting in the citizens of such countries not being able to buy properties due to the abnormally high prices – driven solely by the tremendous demand from Chinese buyers.

The desperation of rich Chinese individuals to somehow get hold of properties in free and democratic countries is a big slap on the Chinese Communist Party’s face. Furthermore, it is also an indicator of the fact that Chinese citizens, who have properties abroad will not think twice before shifting out from the mainland in case the CCP decides to turn the heat on them.**""**

p.s. Chinese Government looks very smart, they want to export and shift their own massive domestic housing bubbles (via cracks down on private sectors) to other Western countries such as Canada, in the meantime they are doing something good that really curb housing prices for their own local citizens in order to tame the soaring costs of livings, as Xi Jinping has stressed many times, ""**Housing should be for living in not for speculations**"". Which really means go outside the country to speculate not here in China. **China's inflation has gone down as CPI was 1% YoY last month**.

"“Generally speaking, Canada undertaxes housing and overtaxes income and sales. That system invites people to invest in housing here without making a living here, including both Canadians and foreigners,” said Thomas Davidoff, associate professor at UBC’s Sauder School of Business.","[https://ricochet.media/en/3786/it-feels-hopeless-housing-an-afterthought-in-election-campaign](https://ricochet.media/en/3786/it-feels-hopeless-housing-an-afterthought-in-election-campaign)

“Overseas buyers were a force in the market in 2014-2016,” said Thomas Davidoff, associate professor at UBC’s Sauder School of Business. It’s “less clear that is a strong effect now.” He does not think banning or taxing overseas buyers will be very effective as existing taxes have limited their participation in the market to a very small share of all transactions.

Yan said Canada is catching up with other countries when it comes to policies for overseas buyers. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia and China all have very clear policies for foreign buying.

Also, Yan thinks federal policies in terms of mortgages, interest rates, taxes, even immigration and immigration support systems have an impact on housing.

“Generally speaking, Canada undertaxes housing and overtaxes income and sales. That system invites people to invest in housing here without making a living here, including both Canadians and foreigners,” said Davidoff. Higher property taxes (e.g., federal capital gains tax on owner gains above a certain threshold) and lower income and sales taxes would lessen the incentive to hold vacation or empty homes.

Inflation due to low-interest rates after COVID-19 is making things worse. “The concerns about inflation on houses are very different than on food prices. For food, you have substitutes so that you can move into other cheap choices. But for housing, there’s a point at which you will be living in the street,” said Yan.

Rezel said when the housing crisis occurred in Singapore in the 1970s, the Singaporean government decided that the only solution was for the government to be involved, so it invested a lot of money in housing. “But the Canadian government just leaves this to everyone else.”

“To improve affordability, either you need to increase the salaries or reduce the home prices,” Rezel said. The former means tripling salaries for many people in Vancouver, which is impossible. And no party in this federal election wants to introduce any measure that will reduce home prices because that will upset voters who are homeowners.

Over 60 per cent of Canadian households own homes, and [recent data](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/vancouver/article-in-vancouver-and-toronto-as-many-as-1-in-5-homeowners-own-more-than) shows that 20 per cent of homeowners in Vancouver own more than one property, a number that is rising.

Housing should have been addressed a decade ago, said Rezel. But no government wants to take on this “political suicide mission,” so the problem continues to grow.

Some homeowners he knows are looking forward to changes, because they don’t want their children or grandchildren to have to move out of Vancouver.

# Distrust of government

During the election campaign, some recent news in Vancouver has made people even more anxious about the housing crisis.

“When you define ‘housing crisis’ in Vancouver, whether it is caused by lacking supply or foreign buyers or speculations or circulation, you cannot quantify that unless you have accurate data. I feel that the biggest obstacle to getting the data is the government,” Rezel says.

A secret study conducted by Revenue Canada in 1996 was recently revealed by the South China Morning Post. It showed wealthy migrants purchased 90 per cent of luxury homes in Metro Vancouver while declaring extremely low incomes. The study had been ignored or even intentionally covered up by the government, and the reporter went through a long ordeal to find it, using access to information legislation to finally access it.

Yan asked why the government doesn’t keep the public informed by disclosing the latest data. “I think there’s certainly a role of federal agencies in terms of ensuring our housing system is transparent and accountable.”

But judging by how the government has behaved so far, it is hard for the public to trust them.

“The crisis of trust in government is probably even bigger than our housing crisis,” Yan said.

The Liberal candidate for Vancouver Granville, Taleeb Noormohamed, was found to have flipped dozens of houses and made a significant profit on the transactions in recent years. This not only conflicts with the Liberal Party’s plan for an anti-flipping tax, but raises concerns about the opacity of data. According to a media report, the federal NDP spent in excess of $800 in fees to access Noormohamed’s property portfolio through the B.C. Land Title and Survey Authority.

“I think the researchers and journalists should have access to the data for free. There’s no reason why not.” Rezel suspects the government doesn’t want people to know what’s going on.

He says housing and transparency advocates have asked the B.C. NDP to waive those fees for journalists and researchers. Instead, Horgan's government even added fees for the newly minted Land Owner Transparency Registry.

In dealing with the ravages of illegal money laundering in B.C., several experts have called on the government to give the public free access to public registries of beneficial ownership for land and companies, in order to provide the benefit of [identifying possible illegal or unethical activity.](https://biv.com/article/2020/06/public-registries-combat-money-laundering-should-be-free-experts)

A 2019 report called “Combatting Money-Laundering in BC Real Estate” says money laundering in the urban real estate markets of B.C. has contributed to the problem of housing affordability, and has increased housing prices by about 5 per cent.

Yan said this is only the tip of the iceberg. The number is much higher in Vancouver, and lots of money laundering still cannot be detected.

The ability to combat money laundering is limited by the lack of accessible government data. According to the report a great deal of government data is not public, or is subject to a complex set of data-sharing arrangements and limitations, some of which may be unnecessarily restrictive.",CanadaHousing,2021-09-22 19:44:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/pte3dg/generally_speaking_canada_undertaxes_housing_and/,795

Demonstrable examples of policy changes that can help,"We are all on this sub because this is an issue that affects millions of Canadians. There ARE concrete ways we can push for change and there ARE existing examples of these changes that we can look to in order to better our situation.

I think that specificity will overall improve our odds of successfully advocating for restraints on the bubbling housing market and can hopefully bring it closer to equilibrium with real wages, which is an entirely different but critical subject we won’t get into here.

I invite informed criticism, discussion and dialogue, because we all need to better focus these ideas to make concise demands of our politicians at every level.

I’ll begin with existing strategies that we can reference elsewhere, focused on Toronto as thats the market I am personally most familiar with

1. Toronto has the most realtors per capita in the world.

Remove them. This is already being proposed in other countries as we digitize the industry and realtors represent roughly 5% of the “value” of a house. We do not need agencies to make cartels out of the housing market and we do not need them gatekeeping, especially in the digitized world where things like zillow and others already exist.

2. Stricter regulation of short term rentals like Airbnb and similar platforms

There are 21,000+ currently active listings currently on Airbnb alone, which represents something in the rang of 65,000-100,000 actual units being used under that SINGLE company, based on a +70% occupancy rate.

That represents almost 10% of homes in Toronto. Probably more when considering ALL of the short term rental properties available. We have hotels for a reason, and they typically bring in more govt revenue through taxes than the shadowy airbnb-adjacent market.

The EU is already implementing policies to curb these short term rentals which will drive down prices as a big chunk of realty is removed from these services and will enter the market, increasing supply, and removing the option for investor/owners to essentially not offer that property on the market to our domestic renters.

3. Federal or Provincially funded housing projects. Municipalities like Toronto cannot continue to be hubs of growth as a result of federal and provincial intervention. If these municipalities have to carry the brunt of federal and provincial policy, then they deserve funding help to administer those policies on the ground. This is a standing problem for Toronto’s existing plans for “rapid” housing projects.

4. Root out corruption.

This is a more vague and deeply systemic problem, and one in which Canada actually ranks, overall, better than most other OECD countries.

However, major municipal corruption is a running gag for Canada. We need better transparency from our provincial or federal government, and more teeth for agencies designed to administer this transparency.

"This is the problem with Canadian Real-Estate, and here's the solution!","**Problem, in short:**

The Canadian real estate market is investor-oriented instead of family-oriented. Largely driven by economic incentives that favor investment returns over housing affordability. The government avoids changing such incentives afraid of economic collapse as a real estate debt is a huge part of the economy.

  
**Problem, long:**

Construction is very expensive, developer charges, taxes, red-tape, bureaucracy, everything increased dramatically over the years. Municipalities have no incentives to reduce those, making new homes very expensive to build. Government on all levels have been tracking ""number of units"" built, that emphasizes on building small condos as a solution.

Canada allows people to buy housing with very little down payment, making real estate investments very leveraged, potentially multiplying gains like no other investments. 

HELOCs are available from day one, and the money can even be used to buy more properties. 

The government allows residential properties to be threated as business, allowing investors to deduct interest payments, maintenance and other costs. This makes it cheaper to buy and rent then to buy and live.

Real estate transactions are not taxed. People can borrow as high as 4x their gross income. Banks allow for multiple people to sign on mortgages, and you even can get more than one mortgage on the same property.

It didn't help that the government decided to allow millions of new immigrants to enter the country while no capacity for new housing was in place to support that.

**The solution, simply put:**

1- Government should track price per sqft by segment (townhouse, detached, duplexes, condo), not number of units built. Prices should trend down on all regions of all provinces. Monitor closely.  
2- Abolish developer charges. Municipalities can charge a standardized fee per sqft to be established by the federal government. As a counter-part, government will give 0.25 base points of the GST for municipalities.  
3- Reduce red tape and bureaucracy, if a permit is not denied in 90 days with a valid-reason it is automatically approved.  
4- HELOCs will not be available until house is fully paid. Max 25% of property value. Must be used on the house itself (new roof, renovation, etc.)  
5- Minimum down payment of 20%, abolish CHMC insurance.  
6- No more than one mortgage per property is allowed.  
7- No co-signers in mortgages are allowed.  
8- Residential properties cannot be treated as business: no interest or any other costs deducted. This will not affect purpose-build rentals. (This will be phased gradually in 10-15 years to soft impact on current landlords)  
9- Max mortgage value: 4x **CRA-verified** gross income for first 100k, 3x gross income for the rest.  
10- Housing sales are fully taxed. If another property is bought in less than 6 months from the selling then only the surplus (if any) is taxed. Each citizen has 1 no-taxed housing sell during their lifetime.  
11- If your property happens to be under-water (your mortgage is higher than your house value), and you own only one house, and you bought it between 2015 and 2025, you can carry the extra debt to your new house if you decide to move. Government will help with a CHMC insurance. (this is to help the few people that could suffer from lower housing prices)  


**Conclusion**

The solution involves making it easier and cheap to build and non-lucrative to speculate. Want to invest in RE? Go build new housing that families want to live in!

House prices have gone up 14%YoY and are at an all time high. What the hell is happening?,"Everyone here that is potentially a first time home buyer is incredibly frustrated, and I am too. In this post I try to reason what is currently happening, and what could happen in the future. Property values have increased massively across Canada in the past year, although I will mostly be focusing on Ontario in this post because that's the only province available on HouseSigma. 

Here is some sample data for all property types (obtained from HouseSigma):

|Area|Sept 2016 Median Price ($)|Sept 2020 Median Price ($)|Sept 2021 Median Price ($)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|London|305,000|485,403|603,000|
|Kitchener|349,900|565,000|728,000|
|Guelph|520,000|617,500|750,400|
|Hamilton|463,250|625,500|770,000|
|Mississauga|588,000|830,000|896,250|
|Barrie|422,000|565,000|740,000|
|GTA|630,000|839,000|980,000|
|Toronto|608,150|891,354|910,000|
|Peterborough|350,000|476,500|617,500|
|Belleville|390,000\*|399,750|510,000|
|Ottawa|320,500|541,000|622,000|

*\*not many data points, may be inaccurate*

And just to make sure everything is relative, here is the most recent data I can compare on Consumer Price Index (CPI), vs median wage for 25-34 year olds in Ontario.

[Fig 1: Comparing inflation with median salary for 25-34 year olds in Ontario. \[1\]\[2\]](https://preview.redd.it/bgx9s6tcltt71.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=37c4f15c1ec00ad0a106528e4908981d84befd0f)

I chose to compare this age group because historically, they are the age group of first time home buyers. When taking into account the above, there are a few issues:

* median income is not outpacing inflation, meaning everyone has less buying power over time even if housing prices were to plateau and keep pace with inflation (this was inflation *before* COVID too, it is worse now)
* housing has increased by at least 10% in the past year alone, with many towns in the GTA **seeing increases of 35% or more**
* for first time home buyers, the price-to-income ratio is rising fast. Assuming a couple buys a home together, the price-to-income ratio has gone from about 8:1 in 2016, to 12:1 now in the GTA. A healthy price-to-income ratio is below 3! *\*one caveat to this is the median income is for all of Ontario, and the local income in the GTA could make this different, however the general trend is likely the same\**

These factors already put first time home buyers at a huge disadvantage and make it incredibly difficult for the younger generation to buy a house, leaving only wealthy families or investors to enter the market. What about current owners? 

Lets take a look at the historical household mortgage debt as a proportion of household disposable income.

[Fig 2: Household debt as a proportion of disposable income from 2000-2020 \[3\]](https://preview.redd.it/cyo8dnvbrtt71.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f98d09a723340a025bf902e3b94cb1b50a062a7)

With people allocating more of their income towards their mortgages, they are taking on much more risk if rates increase before their renewal date. Rates are also at an all time low (shown in Fig 3 below), and cannot get much lower without the government *paying you* to borrow money. They can only go up from here.

[Fig 3: Mortgage rates from 2016 to the end of 2020 \[3\]](https://preview.redd.it/m1byliq5stt71.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd0719377f24bfda38e804e616bbc2177c95e7f2)

In the StatCan report released earlier this year, they said:

>*""Disposable incomes rose 12.7% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2020 from the fourth quarter of 2019, with government transfers up 103.4% over the same period; mortgage credit rose a more modest 3.3%. If mortgage borrowing remains robust and income decreases back to pre-pandemic levels, then households may find themselves with record levels of mortgage debt relative to their current disposable income in subsequent quarters."" \[3\]*

In the past year, a lot of people were calling for a crash due to the pandemic and with how many people lost their income. This didn't happen since the BoC lowered rates further, the government printed billions of dollars to give out wage subsidies, mortgages payments were allowed to be deferred at no penalty, and people were able to just barely scrape by.

Consider the situation we are currently in. Inflation is rising rapidly, wages are stagnant, people are taking on more debt, government wage subsidy programs will be tapered off, and most importantly the **Bank of Canada will likely be forced to raise rates in 2022**. \[4\] 

If wages do not keep up with inflation, people will need to allocate more of their disposable income towards food, reducing the amount they can pay towards their mortgage. Coupling this with interest rates increasing and therefore debt servicing cost, this will put an insane amount of pressure on home owners. 

Many investors also bought a home this year and did renos when materials and construction services were in high demand. These reno costs aren't even factored in, and they could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to homeowner debt.

Not only home owners will have difficulty paying for shelter too. With increased inflation tenants will need to allocate more of their income towards food, meaning less is available for rent. Feeding yourself takes priority over shelter. I don't have much hard data on the increase in rent, but anecdotally in my area it has gone up about 50% in the past 3 years. People will not be able to pay for these increases indefinitely, especially after moving or being evicted incurs the current raised rental rates on people with previously lower cost leases. Investors who rent out their houses and rely on that income to pay off their mortgage, will start to default on their loans when tenants can't pay.

Fuel will only be added to the fire when the Liberals implement their First Home Savings Account, giving buyers more purchasing power without solving supply. I also doubt any meaningful policies will be enacted from the Liberals to calm the market from investors either, as members of their own party profit off it \[5\]. 

Unfortunately in the short term, prices are likely to increase more. However, I strongly believe that there are many indicators for a crash coming as soon as rates increase and sentiment worsens. **In the 2017 bubble, it only took 4 months for prices to correct 18% due to change in sentiment alone**. This bubble was fueled almost entirely by speculation \[6\]:

* buyers were much more willing to take on cash flow negative homes due to potential future property value gains
* investors believed they could make huge gains on riding the increase. For example, if an investor bought a $1M house, put down $200,000, and it appreciated in a year to $1.2M, the initial investment of $200,000 has doubled in value ($200,000 gain before taxes and other costs).
* fear of being priced out, people would buy homes for their family in anticipation of values rising outside their means, increasing demand
* population growth rates remained relatively stable around 1%, and were not abnormal (immigrants were not a main driving force)
* new construction rates was increasing in the years leading up to 2017 (supply was not an issue)
* people tuned out the talk of bubbles, for nearly 10 years a bubble had been predicted
* the rate of homeowners selling increased 29% from the 10 year average, meaning people were capitalizing on the premium
* inventory then started to increase through Spring of 2017
* when offers started to slow (going from 20 offers on first day, to none) people started to panic. They would be carrying the house they just bought, in addition to the old house they can't sell. This drove them to sell their old house below market value to have the capital to pay for the new one on closing day.
* when banks appraised the value of a home near closing day, the price had dropped drastically. The mortgages were approved for values *less than what people committed to buying the house for,* meaning the buyer had to come up with the difference. This caused some buyers to walk away from their deposits, and the owner had to relist the home. The owner also had to drop the price because they had already committed to a new place and needed the cash, putting more downward pressure on the market.

All of these characteristics leading up to the 2017 bubble are here again, but unlike 2017 where mortgage rates remained relatively stable, they are likely to go up. When the housing market corrects this time, I would not be surprised if values drop further than 18%, as people are more leveraged, price-to-income ratios are higher, mortgages payments take up more disposable income, and FUD will cause massive sell offs from investors cashing out. In the 2008 housing bubble in the states, some of the hardest hit cities saw drops of 50% from the peak value \[6\]. In Canada, we are also more sensitive to rate hikes as fixed rate mortgages are renegotiated at least every 5 years. US fixed rate mortgages span the lifetime of the loan and don't change.

One argument against a crash is that the market will be propped up by people waiting on the sidelines, and any drop in price will be filled by them. I don't believe this will happen when large quantities of houses come on the market, as this group is a minority compared to people who already own homes. In the 2016 census (2021 isn't available yet), **1,411,900 households in Ontario were paying over 30% of their income towards their shelter** \[7\]. This is a HUGE amount of homes (that is likely larger now in 2021) that would eclipse demand waiting on the sidelines, flooding the market. Normally, only about 225,000 households are sold every year in Ontario \[8\]. Even if a fraction of the 1.4M households mentioned previously get put on the market, it would increase supply substantially.

I strongly advocate everyone who is trying to save up for a home to [know their rights as a tenant](https://www.ontario.ca/page/renting-ontario-your-rights), as investors will likely try to force their increase in debt payments on their tenants. If you are paying your rent and do not damage the property, **you cannot be evicted without compensation**. Keep waiting and save as much as you can. Home owners who have been in the market for a long time have nothing to worry about, as they already have a huge unrealized gain in their house. Home owners who have entered recently and are allocating 30%+ income towards mortgage payments need to tread carefully.

This sub should focus more on supply issue,"Yes Canada housing is expensive. No yelling at landlords, banning airbnb, raising property taxes will not bring down prices. BC have speculation taxes, is pretty unfriendly to airbnb, have rent control in place for a longtime. How's that working out for housing affordability? The definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again and expect different results. 

Any solution that does not address the housing supply issue is doomed to failed. Throughout most of the country, it is either downright illegal or extremely difficult to build anything like a four plex, let alone denser buildings like 6 storied condos with 10-15 units. And the government can change this with a stoke of the pen. Yes there are work to be done to upgrade infrastructure to allow for more density. But this will increase property taxes and should be more than enough to pay for any upgrade.

People want to come to Canada. And who can blame them? It is a pretty great country, problems not withstanding. I for one am an immigrant and extremely grateful that this country accept me with open arms. And these new comers make Canada stronger, smarter and better. There are strong demand for Canadian housing, this is welcome and we should increase the supply radically to meet it.

For those who worried that up zoning will ""change the character of the neighborhood"", first of all screw you... If housing is a human right, ""character of the neighborhood"" must take second place. Secondly, denser cities could be very beautiful and charming. There is a little known city in Europe called Paris, maybe you heard of it. There are a lot of medium size buildings and cafe restaurants everywhere. I heard it is nice. Why couldn't Canadian cities be like that?

Just my two cents and I am prepared to be down voted into oblivion lol.",CanadaHousing,2023-06-06 18:08:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/142mhuv/this_sub_should_focus_more_on_supply_issue/,155
Realistic summary of what's going on and where we are headed,"I noticed that this and other forums (looking at you TorontoRealEstate) have descended into an us vs. them kinda situation.

I thought I'd try and add a realistic summary of what's going on from the point of view of someone who keeps an eye on global economic and monetary trends and has been investing in the stock market for a few years now. Here is a high-level summary of how we got here and where we are likely headed (my opinion only). I am not bullish on real estate, the stock market or the economy in general.

1. We started off pre-pandemic with an acknowledged housing bubble in certain cities in Canada (primarily Vancouver and Toronto)
2. Interest rates being low since 2008 were a driving force coupled with an unwillingness by anyone in government to tackle the very obvious speculation and money laundering in real estate. MPs like Taleeb and even our current housing (and diversity?) minister (Hussein) actively had and continue to have multiple fingers in multiple housing pies. The government encouraged speculation and enjoyed the 'paper growth' it added to the GDP. You didn't need hindsight to see that this was a bad idea.
3. A 20 year bull cycle in Canadian real estate (particularly in Vancouver and the GTA) coupled with a lack of government action to address speculation led to excessive confidence among buyers and investors who confidently declared (and continue to do so) that 'RE in Canada only goes up'. Canada was spared the lessons of 2008 that US real estate investors experienced. The main lesson of the 2008 crisis was that real estate does crash and it tends to crash very badly when it does.
4. Interestingly, we saw a slight decline in some cities around 2017-2018 as interest rates crept up a bit and some foreign buyer taxation was passed (in Vancouver anyway). However, the government continued to ignore that a large part of speculative demand was driven by domestic investors. They still pretend like this isn't happening. The supply that is starting to show up is proving there are more domestic 'investors' than they wanted to acknowledge.
5. It's 2020 and Covid arrived. No one saw it coming. Asset classes started to dive but central banks around the world decided to lower interest rates to nearly 0 and proceeded to lend copious amounts of money to governments. The great everything bubble is born.
6. Inflation arises and the exact cause is hotly debated. Personally, I believe it was a combination of low interest rates, excessive cheap debt and speculation in certain asset classes coupled with real world supply chain and logistics issues. I don't believe inflation will go away for a long, long time. I think it will take minimum 2-3 years and possibly longer if they don't raise rates high enough or decide to pause/reduce before the data shows that inflation has been properly dealt with. Inflation is as much psychological as it is a physical aspect of prices.
7. 2022, we get a war in Ukraine - the world's 'breadbasket'. No one saw it coming. I didn't even know they were the world's breadbasket until the war. As it turns out, this war is bad news for everyone and it arrives at a time when economies worldwide are still on their knees from the global pandemic shock.  Now we have to deal with an energy crisis and a foodgrain crisis in the VERY NEAR future.
8. Together, inflation and the war exacerbate the problem of supply and affordability. Prices go up and we are now headed towards serious shortages worldwide coupled with inflating prices in certain key commodities. Several countries have begun to ban exports of critical commodities (like wheat and foodgrains). The impact of this is YET to be felt.
9. The US Federal Reserve have realized their error and have begun to raise rates. They realize they were too slow to address inflation (it wasn't 'transitory' after all) and have lost a lot of credibility. Bond rates reflect this and forced their hand too. The US Feds understand that if they lose more credibility, the US dollar begins to lose its status as a reliable world currency and store of value. They must aggressively rein in inflationary expectations and keep the value of the USD fairly stable. This is good for international trade and business (which the US and every nation ultimately depends on today).
10. At the same time, owing to massive government debt burdens and inflated asset classes (stocks, housing and some commodities), rising rates pose a problem for heavily indebted businesses, individuals and governments. 20 years of increasing stimulus is hard to wean off.

This is the situation we are in now. If central banks don't forcefully address inflation by raising rates, the idea that everything is getting more expensive will become embedded into people's everyday expectations. Can you imagine if the cost of everyday goods that has seen a sudden price increase in the last 12 months doubles by this time next year? How will you react? Will you buy more or save your money in expectation of future expenses?

This is also why we are undoubtedly heading into the worst recession of our lifetimes. Put aside your bullish or bearish bias and consider how many unprecedented shocks the entire global system has endured over the last 3 years. During this time, asset classes have inflated when everything should have been logically contracting. The reason is simple - they borrowed heavily from the future (or from thin air if you prefer to think of it that way) to stabilize an unsteady situation. Instead of the money being used to support and grow local economies in a productive manner, people and businesses used it to speculate on assets (people overleveraged on housing and businesses on share buybacks, corporate bonuses, etc.). Obviously, there was little or no growth generated to compensate for these temporarily cheap loans.

Now, central banks and governments have to choose - do they sacrifice the asset bubbles and allow the system to reset in a healthy if painful way or keep playing the cheap debt game and watch the problem get bigger until it explodes in an unpredictable way in the not very distant future. If it wasn't for Covid and all that followed, they could have possibly kept the system going for a lot longer. They weren't counting on this 'black swan event' from disrupting a fragile system.

**Outcomes:**

House prices are going down. This is going to shock many people because all we've witnessed for 20 years is housing go up (in Canada anyway).

It doesn't matter if you paid $1 million for your townhouse in Scugog or Mission or wherever - it was never really worth $1 million anyway. The hope that this ponzi scheme (that is what it essentially is, just official and endorsed) will continue indefinitely makes 0 sense. Housing is tied to the stability of local economies and the cost of housing (buying or renting) directly impacts how much money people have left over to spend on other areas of the economy. Surely, even the least financially educated person must realize that housing is a non-productive asset ultimately. If allowed to inflate so far beyond affordability to the point where even renting isn't an option for a sizebale chunk of your population, your economy is going to die.

The stock market is going down. This is already playing out in real time. We may see short rallies but ultimately, a bear market is setting in. Stocks are far more liquid than houses so we see moves in this asset class before we see it in housing. It has already begun in the US. Pay attention to how it plays out there. It has also already begun here in Canada and will continue to spiral downwards.

We are headed into the worst recession of our lifetime. There are simply no precedents for the situation we find ourselves in (not just Canada, but all countries globally). Things have never looked so bleak and the confidence being feigned by governments and central banks are a facade. They are frightened as they rightfully should be.

Why do so many people who represent regular retail believe that they know more than billionaires and smart money? Many very successful businessmen (Grantham, Dalio, Burry to name just 3) as well as several noted economists have all being saying for some time now that things are about to get much worse than people expect.

The people who have seen their assets inflate want to believe that the gravy train will keep going. It's human nature - I'm winning and why won't my pile of money keep getting bigger forever? But this time things really are different. It's going to hurt asset class owners as much as it has everyone else. The heavily overleveraged are about to suffer the worst.

Final note - this sort of turmoil tends to lead to unpredictable outcomes. We didn't see covid coming, we didn't see the Ukraine war and we didn't see inflation arising. Yet, everyone thinks it will be smooth sailing from here? I think things are going to get much worse before they get any better. Things could play out smoothly - they could (magically) get inflation under control in 6 months but try and think logically about everything that has led to where we are and all the other unexpected surprises along the way - do you really believe everything is going to move smoothly from here?  


**Edit:** I forgot to add - The BoC is also about to embark on QT (Quantitative Tightening) for the first time in its history. This is the opposite of QE and is just one more factor to keep an eye on.

The simple math behind one of the main reasons for the housing bubble,"For the last 30 years, Canadian home owners have seen their property values skyrocket. Here is how they used it for their advantage (these are base on real numbers before the interest rate hikes of 2021):

House price bought in 1990: $100,000

House value in 2021: $2,000,000

1) Owner takes out a loan (HELOC) against their property for 80% of the property’s value ($1,600,000) for 2% interest (that was historically a loan’s interest rate, but now of course it’s a lot higher) 

2) Owner uses the money to buy 4 one-bedroom apartments for $400,000 each.

3) Owner rents out the apartments for $2,000 / month each (yes these are the rent prices in Vancouver), netting $8,000 /  month in revenue.

4) Interest on the loan is $1,600,000 * 0.02 / 12 = $2666.67 / month AND is fully deductible for taxes.

5) Taxes: 
- Income: $8,000 * 12 = $96,000
- Taxable income: $96,000 - $2666.67 * 12 = $96,000 - $32,000 = $64,000 
- Profit earned after interest before taxes: $64,000

6) As property values of the home and the apartments increase, simply request the bank to increase the HELOC and use the new money to buy more apartments. 

7) Repeat indefinitely as long as interest < Rent revenue.

So you earn $96,000 annually and get taxes less than a normal T4 employee. Congrats! Free money! 



These are REAL numbers based on multiple interviews I had with individuals who own 10+ properties each. Of course, due to high interest rates, it is no longer profitable to do that, but if you managed to buy in multiple years ago, you are set for life. This also means that Canada potentially has a permanent population that is unproductive but is able to feed of rents. Only time will tell how this will turn out in the long run.


Edit: These numbers do differ between regions, but the idea remains true everywhere. As long as in the end of the day, your profits are more than your costs (interest, taxes, maintenance, etc) housing speculation will continue to happen and will continue to fuel the housing crisis.",CanadaHousing,2023-06-08 02:52:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/143vwzh/the_simple_math_behind_one_of_the_main_reasons/,288
Canadian Real Estate will lead to a devastating market crash,"Anytime there’s a high frequency of fraud for a protracted period of time in a given free market system, a hard crash is imminent. In Canada, the median income is $50K-$80K. CMHC uses 44% is as the maximum TDS for mortgage assessment. What this means is that, all debt payments inclusive of your mortgage should not exceed 44% of your income. If we take both of these hard stats into consideration, over 90% wouldn’t legally qualify for a mortgage. However, home sales are at an all time high which begs the question how do people afford these mortgages?

Income reporting fraud in order to qualify for mortgage is becoming quite rampant. Banks today claim that their mortgages are secured based on their approval process. If this approval process is rigged from the start to begin with, we should all be very scared. This is not about for or against the current housing trend, we are talking about broader economic implications because of questionable mortgages out there. It’s not much of a problem if household debt is a little over 50%-60%. However, if this amount inches closer to 80%-95%, which is happening right now due to increasing home prices and interest rates, we are facing serious debt problems which may very well bankrupt people. 

When home prices increase, so does rent. With growing inflation and interest rates, Unaffordability sky rockets. Regardless of how much this government increases its immigration, if know one can afford to stay, cities will slowly become empty. Compared to the US our tax rates are incredibly high. Sure we have free Medicare, but if inflation continues to be a problem for the upcoming year along with rising home prices, even if people wanted to stay, they wouldn’t be able to afford it due to financial pressures.

Either home prices need to come down or wages need to go up. If either of them doesn’t happen, we are looking at a disastrous future. As I previously mentioned, this is not about whether you are for higher prices or not, there’s rampant fraud happening within the real estate industry going unchecked and its being exploited at every turn. When the cards start to collapse, no amount of ifs and but would help us weather the damage.",CanadaHousing,2022-04-21 20:29:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/u8vi14/canadian_real_estate_will_lead_to_a_devastating/,291
Want to remove speculators from Canadian housing? Repeat this everywhere.,"There is a solution, apart from increasing supply (that still has to happen). The most important thing for the long-term future of housing, however, is to prevent speculators from abusing houses as an investment vehicle. Here's how:

* Outlaw corporations from owning residential real estate (this is to mainly prevent anonymous ownership)
* Ban foreign ownership
* Implement a yearly speculator's tax after your 2nd or 3rd home (per household) based on the current market value (You got three secondary/investment $1M homes? You're paying 200k/year per house, now, rented or not. $2M home? 400k/year) to completely destroy the speculative side of real estate investment. Either you live in your house, or you rent/own 1-2 extra homes, anything else will require you to dump way more money into the Canadian economy than your house could ever be expected to appreciate, decimating house hoarding as a valid investment strategy.
* For high-density housing units, require businesses managing them to be partnerships (not corps), with a maximum amount of units per partner (after that, speculators' tax kicks in). The rest can be managed by the government.

No need to raise interest rates for mortgages if speculation goes away. Want to afford a house? This is how. It's the only way to make housing affordable and connected to reality again.",CanadaHousing,2021-11-23 21:46:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/r0mtsl/want_to_remove_speculators_from_canadian_housing/,349
I am genuinely curious....how are people paying their rent/mortgages?,"I (37F) ended up in a good financial position over the years.  This started  with buying my first house at 21 while still in university (using RRSPs for the down payment which i saved by working 3 jobs) and eventually buying/selling to build equity (none of which were properties we flipped ..we just get bored and move lots). For a while, we buckled down and paid off a crap ton of debt by eating the cheapest and worst food possible.. once we paid off the debt (car loans, student loans, etc), we began to save.  

  My husband and I took a risk and started a business which we sold for profit and most recently we sold our house last December after the market value skyrocketed due to the COVID boom. We decided to sell as there were tons of talk of interest rates rising and our mortgage was up for renewal...while we locked in at 2.79 for three years we worried what they may be when it was time to renew again. Subsequently, the next month was the start of the climb of interest rates...We ended up selling and moved 3 hours away to a bedroom community near a bigger city that still had cheap property. This has resulted in being debt free. 

We have been watching the markets very closely.  Property everywhere is so much money.  I have been looking at downsizing and moving into a condo so i can be closer to a downtown.  But the price of condos is nuts but add in  condo fees of around $600-$900/month and it is just crazy.  Who can  pay $2000/month for a mortgage plus the condo fees and utilities?

I know people are paying anywhere from $2200 to $3300/ month. But how are you guys doing it when the average Canadian income is $55-60k?

From a Canadian millennial perspective... I just don't get what the economic end game is?,"\*\*ALERT LONG POST\*\*\*

Hey All,

I am a millennial who rents a 1 bedroom condo with his millennial fiancé. Although we can afford more, we choose to live a very frugal life so that we can save every penny we can to eventually buy an overvalued piece of property somewhere in southern Ontario. Although we're not 1 percenters, we earn a respectable combined gross annual income of \~$150,000 and we have literally zero debt obligations (no car payments, no children/dependents, no student debt, no consumer debt, etc.) so we're actually doing fairly well for ourselves when you rank our expendable income vs. most households in Canada.

This morning I was tabulating how much we've saved for a down payment and although we're in the six figures, it's of course not enough. This made me lament about how poor I feel (even though my household income firmly puts me in the middle/upper middle class spectrum). We don't go out, we own 1 car (a 10 year old Kia I bought for $5,000 in 2017), don't really buy clothes, don't purchase electronics, vacations are rare and non-existent during the past 18 months all in an effort to pump as much of our earnings into various investment assets to hopefully have enough money to buy a property.

This got me thinking... well once I have enough to cover a 20% down payment on a home, my lifestyle MUST remain the same because all the money I'm saving now will go to some ridiculous $3,000+ monthly mortgage + property taxes + fees, etc.

I know I'm not the only one who has been forced to really cut back on their lifestyle due to housing costs, and with that means drastic decrease in consumption across the board. Thinking back to economics, if a significant chunk of the population is in either one of three camps:

1. Barely getting by with all their income going to basic needs.
2. Saving up as much as they can so they can own a home one day
3. 'House poor' because their monthly fees are insane

Thinking back to basic economics; wouldn't this lead to a drop in consumer consumption, and eventually decreased production and cause stagnation at best, but realistically a recession, possibly a depression in the long run? Sure GDP will increase short term because housing costs have exploded, but no one can afford to buy anything, even households in the 75% percentile such as myself will keep consumption low with what would have been expendable income being eaten by a large mortgage or saving up to buy a house . Speaking long term and on the aggregate, how is this good for an economy? I don't understand, no one consumes, therefore no one produces, so we have an economy with production and consumption dropping... who cares what homes are worth? How does this improve the economy or the lives of citizens on the aggregate?

The only people this is good for are people who bought their homes decades ago and have no mortgages to pay off, but honestly, what % of the populace falls into that category? Furthermore with more and more of our populace being born after housing prices exploded, that percentage will dwindle. Eventually there will be people who make $250,000 year being thrust into my dilemma, then $300,000, and upwards as this continues to get worse. Eventually you'll have people in the 90th percentile of income earners struggling to buy a home - I just don't see how an economy can survive like this? How is our nation going to be competitive on the global stage like this? Sure we'll have a landed elite class who owns everything, but there will be nothing to own other than real estate, no factories, no warehouse, no cutting edge technology plants... so everyone loses in the long run.

Can someone let me know if I'm missing something... I just don't get why we're doing this?

&#x200B;

"In China's big cities Beijing, Shanghai etc., only city locals can own maximum two properties per household, and for foreiners or non local-resident other Chinese citizens, only one property allowed to buy and you must work and pay local taxes for more than 5 years! plus renting out is PROHIBITED!","https://adamfayed.com/why-is-buying-property-in-china-as-a-foreigner-a-bad-idea/amp/

This applies to non local residents. For apple to apple, It is like you live in Toronto and you cannot buy any property in Halifax unless you physically work in Halifax and pay local taxes in Halifax for more than 5 years, but after 5 years still only one Halifax property allowed to buy and no chance to be a rental landlord in Halifax lifetime if you are migrant to Halifax such as Toronto's boomer retiring in Halifax because you basically already allowed to have two properties in T.O. your hometown so you come to Halifax you only can rent no buying unless you are rehired in Halifax and continue to work for another 5 years as boomer to become eligible to buy locally in Halifax and for live in only, no renting out allowed. This way allows young local Halifax worker also first-time buyers to avoid the disvantagous competition from T.O.'s retired boomer buyers who migrate to Halifax and never lived/worked in there before but with million dollar cash after sold his/her hometown's property.

I mean in China the law (new game rules) really give local taxpayers a better and fairer treatment in terms of local residential property buying or renting out as local landlords. Because locals have worked for years and/or for generations and contributed to tax bases for building all local Infrastructures/public services such as Hospitals, roads, transits, schools, libraries, policing, firefighting, water/waste treatments, seniors caretakings, etc. This sounds very logical and reasonable policy.

They only take minimum 5 years of local work and income tax paying as local residential property entering criteria no matter you are foreigner, P.R. or Chinese citizens who live in other regions, no nationality/racial discrimination at all. Simple like that. Work 5 Years - Pay Income Taxes - Own RE - Maximum Two. No fuking around game playing the system.

If you think about the rationale behind China's big cities this new game rule change in RE, from policy point of view, they really want local city's young working class people, who are priced out but already started career more than 5 years and earn good staple incomes, being able to own property for them to live-in having family and contribute taxes because they are the real backbones for the local economy not only for now but also for the future. Same as Canada, China's population are aging fast and birth rate is low now. They have to keep the young skilled workers/professinals stay, have children (increase birth rate) and not run away, seriously. Good forward Policy thinking. You lose the young you lose the future. 

And in Canada we try to solve the low birth rate aging population issues by increasing immigrant volumes, however at this level of housing affordablilty, extreme housing supply shortage, high cost of livings and less good paying job opportunities, the best bet is you most likely get people who are already wealthy back home and only willing to come here because they can harbor wealth, enjoy better educations, better environments as well as free healthcare system where home country has none and get best investment returns for their own money (legal or illegal) in RE and the gains are tax free or just become landlords/AirBnB owners to rent out collecting passive incomes. They are already somehow rich/established and can afford to buy RE but not going to work any real jobs to pay T4 taxes as such some rich immigrants end up having satellite family/houses here but being classified as low income people here in Canada under CRA's criteria, this fault T4 based criteria result wrong income data collected and thus wrong fiscal Policy decisions could be made. When looking back this only leads to the tax bases shrinking, deficits skyrocketing, housing prices soaring, young skilled workers/professionals priced out leaving and heavily RE based GDP fake debt-growing economy just like we have already experienced in the last couple years. The policy did fail as matter of fact and the whole young generation are entirely priced out. What you really need to do at Policy Level is you must make housing affordable for the young working people at any cost any measures to retain them because they are the backbone and future of the country and only they can give birth to our children (increase birth rate) and bring new ideas/knowledge, new innovations and productivity (increase tax revenues) through hard work to pay for the ever aging and tax consuming populations.

On the other hand, if you dare to game the system in China like the Liberal MP did in B.C. flipping so many properties and profited in millions in just several years, once get caught in there you done and are facing serious criminal charges based on the amount of illegal gains you make and that guy may easily end up with more than 25 years in jail time and lost all his properties, no joke.

"The Berlin housing revolution :The city is seriously considering proposals to seize apartments from landlords to resolve its housing crisis. Is it an extreme throwback to its communist days, or a bold move that could offer a solution to other European cities?","https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news-europe-news-berlin-and-threat-to-seize-property-8089804/

In Canada, BoC through its Coporate Bond Purchase Program (CBPP) and Canada Mortgage Bond Purchase Program (CMBP) have bought billions not trillions dollars of debts/liabilitity for the owners of many private companies as well as homeowners mortgage liabilities in the hard times of pandemic that every one suffers and renters are suffer the most. 

Basically Government via BoC has delivered the ""communist"" style benefits/welfares only to the already rich and assets owner classes, and for all renters they are the class to be hardly hit and exploited and zero money to help and many lost jobs facing evictions. For renters there are only endless empty promises from one year to next from one PM to another for so called affordable housings.

You see home equities' values are skyrocketing without the owners themselves even moving a single finger to actually EARN it. WITHOUT these unfair ""Communism for the Rich"" market interventional approach of policies/monetary operations and zero interest rates, during and after pandemic, the asset bubbles should have long been bursted by itself in the REAL FREE MARKET SETTINGS that elite capitalists are so afraid of and housing prices also have long been much affordable for the average Canadians/families if let the bubbles burst following the law of jungle in marketplace, the marketplace demands much higher interest rate not the artificially manipulated zero rate. We in fact live in a ""Communism for the rich/owner class"" society, not  so diversified economically, especially homeowners vs. renters and young people vs. babyboomers, and foreign investors vs. local buyers, such HUGE wealth gap and inequality. Is this the kind of society we all want to achieve for ourselves and for the generations to come? Life is short rich or poor we all die no one can carry a penny when we die, isn't it?

The Government has allowed foreigner non-residents to buy RE in Canada for long time,  the reason for that is they know locals cannot afford to buy at these inflated prices, to maintain the highly bubbled prices and not to fall even 10%, they urgently need to 'invite' foreign citizens/investors to purchase or criminally money laundering.

Another example is these Residential REITs super wealthy and affluent corporations, they bought up almost all rental property inventories across Canada and have squeezed out many many tenants or significantly increase rental prices in order to return maximum capital gains/profits to their shareholders/investors and many residential REITs pay very high dividents like 4% to 12% a year on monthly basis, all these 'dividents' are draining the bloods from poor and/or senior tenants' after-tax hard earned cash or humble pensions who are so struggugling to even make ends meet at today's high cost of livings for everything.

And Canadian tax laws give REIT companies all kinds tax exemptions. And during pandemic BoC bought BILLIONS DOLLARS of their debts to give REIT companies huge breaks and they can use the BoC cash injections to acquire more rental apartments, in fact these REIT companies many are 'SHELL' assets management company and not hiring many workers at all but obtain all these Government tax benefits/BoC bail outs. All these residential REIT stocks are now enjoying historically the highest stock prices at the expenses of renters paying the highest rents for very basic human shelter needs nothing close to luxury. And their greedy investors are keep demanding higher dividents to exploit the renters further..Residential purposed rental properties are not supposed to be investment products and they are very basic Human Rights and Needs..Period.

Crunched some numbers.,"This was a comment I made in an earlier thread but thought it could use some light.

""A quick google shows that by Stats Canada's own figures the number of renting Canadians is increasing by twice the amount of Canadians buying homes. The average home in Canada hit 716,000$ up 10% since Jan. That puts a min down payment at 46,600$. Looks like in 2021 about 35.6% of Canadians made less than 50,000$ annual wage. So let's say a working couple bringing in a combined annual of 80,000$ want to start a family in a home to call their own. With today's cost of living piled onto extreme rent prices nation wide and a housing market that is always increasing that average cost up, it seems very unlikely that this couple ever hope to save up enough money to buy that dream.""",CanadaHousing,2023-05-19 18:07:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/13m1i9e/crunched_some_numbers/,106
"Solving Canada's Housing Crisis with ""Insane"" Solutions on Canada Day","Happy Canada Day Everyone!

Just sharing my patriotic thoughts on how we can finally tackle Canada's Housing Crisis with solutions our politicians would never have the courage to introduce.

You don't have to be a politician, banker, or investor to know that Canada is in deep trouble when it comes to housing and if drastic measures are not taken to address both our affordability and supply problems, things are not going to work out well for the generations of the future.

Here's what we can do in support of raising interest rates and ""building more"" to get out of this mess:

1.) Introduce a nationwide rent-freeze until rental rates re-align with average household income.

2.) Increase foreign buyer tax to 30-50% and do not allow foreigners to buy or hold properties in cooperation with permanent residents or Canadian Citizens.

3.) Limit the number of investment properties a Canadian can hold to 1.

4.) Introduce additional taxes and premiums to investment property owners. They will pay an aggressive premium and won't be able to pass it on to the renter thanks to the nationwide rent-freeze introduced.

5.) Regulate home builders with price controls and primary resident quotas. They must sell 80% of their inventory to individuals using the homes as their primary residence. The # of units they can sell to investors must be strictly limited.

6.) Introduce an empty bedroom tax. If you live in a home with more than 2 empty bedrooms, you will pay an additional premium on your property tax bill.

7.) Start building homes and communities of the future. What do they look like? How can we build them quicker and more efficient than current construction standards that will never catch up with demand? We can't keep building using the past models. Something new and innovative needs to be introduced to the market to help balance off the market.

8.) The government needs to partner with builders to tear down the slums and build sustainable housing for the future, and this must be done aggressively and consistently.

9.) Introduce Government Land Grants that allows builders to convert single family homes into 4-8 units where the Grant is offered on a purchase price cap and resale prices are regulated. This will help to squeeze missing middle land costs down.

10.) More needs to be done to solve the unending homeless problem that exists across Canada's major cities. These people need a clean and sustainable housing solution. No one should be left to live on the streets regardless of their situation.

These are rough ideas that require further debate and development. Our country is asleep at the wheel as far as housing goes. The majority of our people will be screwed without drastic measures.",CanadaHousing,2023-07-01 07:13:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/14nnfoh/solving_canadas_housing_crisis_with_insane/,57
The housing crisis can put hate in your heart,"The housing crisis is so frustrating. And there's nowhere we can even direct that frustration, so it festers into hate. And then there's nowhere to direct that hate. So it starts to poison you.

It doesn't look like anything we want will happen any time soon. Even blind bidding seems impossible, despite Ontario already studying it, despite it not impacting prices at all, despite some realtors supporting it, despite wide public support, despite many news articles about it. There is no will from politicians to even pluck the lowest-hanging fruit. What hope do we have for larger reform?

Meanwhile we're told basically no one can be blamed here. Angry at Boomers? You're told ""they just lived their lives, they can't be blamed!"" Mad at homeowners? ""Well they're just trying to get by like everyone else."" Realtors? ""They're not all bad, some are doing good things."" Bank of Canada? ""Their hands are tied, and anyway it's not their job to worry about home prices."" Investors? ""They're not doing anything illegal, just making a honest buck!""

And politicians? Well, sure, be mad at them, but most voters are homeowners and no alternative choices exist that even back housing reform. We're not likely to kick out the ones we dislike. Even Adam Vaughan, who's in a riding with mostly renters, seems quite protected.

Meanwhile the government is not even talking about this issue. Pierre Pollievre and Brad Vis have raised it, but what solutions do they have? Liberals are ignoring it entirely. NDP has raised it with some good ideas and some dreadful ones. It's clear every politician's first goal is protecting equity. So when they say ""build more,"" they mean they'll build some denser 2-bedroom units that you can buy for the same price as a single family home last year and shut up and be happy. Or they'll build more rentals so you can rent forever while homeowners get richer. That's a solution we're supposed to be happy with?

What are we supposed to do with this situation? What happens when you take a generation and tell them their futures are going to shit. But not only that, half of society is ABSOLUTELY FUCKING LOVING EVERY SECOND OF THIS. That's the thing that gets me most. It's one thing to go through an economic depression, and a lot of people are in the dumps, and there's some solidarity in that. You are all struggling, the government sees it and must act. But the housing crisis is ""K-shaped."" For us, we're the bottom half of the K — going down and down, and losing, and seeing our buying power disappear, and our prospects for a decent future disappear. But the top half of the K is literally only getting richer. Homeowners? Richer in equity, richer in HELOCs. Sellers? Richer in dollars, a lot of dollars. Boomers? Richer in both. Investors? Richer and getting even richer as they use proceeds today to snatch up *1 out of every 5 properties* on the market today. ONE OUT OF FIVE. (Or 1 out of 4 in Toronto and Hamilton.)

Meanwhile our regulators are doing nothing. RECO gives a slap on the wrist to every realtor offense. CMHC releases no useful data. CRA doesn't investigate money laundering. MLS continues to hoard all data. Provinces refuse to release the data they have to help us understand the market. Even BC's new portal, which shows how many properties owned by numbered companies among other things, costs $5 per record. We can't get good visibility with that kind of restriction. Why not dump the database for download and let us see??

Behind all this, the media is entirely ignoring the issue. They are still writing ""wow over-asking"" stories. Still! The Bank of Canada says investors are buying 1/5 properties but that's ""insignificant"" and so the media completely ignores it. We are living through the largest wealth inequality event in history, the largest economic crisis of the pandemic, the largest money laundering scandal in Canadian history, the largest collection of scummy and unethical investors and realtors in cooperation to juice prices and make each other richer... **all happening at once!** And we get absolutely no coverage of any of this stuff?

Where does that leave us? I woke up today just absolutely drowning in despair over this. We are David they are Goliath. We have no stones to throw. We can't Wall Street Bets our way forward as there's no real way to interfere with their profits. They will continue buy the homes we'd otherwise buy, and we'll rent their basements, and we'll be told it just has to be this way.

And behind all this, it's only getting worse. Boomers may die (one day..) but their philosophy remains. NIMBYism is still strong even in Vancouver, a place with the worst of all housing crises. And investors are growing and growing, soon they will absolutely control the market, all new builds will be purchased by investors. That's not far off, it's already happening in Ireland and it's probably happening here, we just don't have any visibility into the market because the MLS/realtors hide all the information we need to see what's happening.

This leaves us desperate, frustrated, hopeless, with zero options and zero power.

Canadian Landlord Foundation,"What if we had a non-profit foundation(s) to own rental housing? If a lot of the problems in the rental market do in fact come from landlords seeking profits, if properties were owned by a non-profit those problems might disappear. And profits are just an extra cost - a company that isn't collecting profits can charge less, which here is lower rents.

We create a foundation - or maybe a crown corporation, a cooperative - who's job is to rent out properties. Lend it a huge amount of money, which it uses to buy land and build houses.

Maybe it's the government providing the loans, maybe it's individuals. I know we've got too much debt already, but the great thing here is it pays off that debt with the money it gets from renting out houses. Very similar to the process that happens when a family gets a mortgage to buy a house then pays it off. Just on a much larger scale, and for people who rent.

Housing is a solid investment, the foundation would eventually be expected to pay off its debts. Low risk investment. Even while charging slightly lower rent - not making a profit should allow for that. Once its debts were paid off, operating at cost it could charge really low rents - it would just have to charge enough to pay the property taxes and take care of repairs. 

Rents would probably actually be *too* low in that situation - everyone would be fighting over those rentals, it distorts the markets. Although Vienna seems to manage to make it work. Alternatively the foundation could keep charging its same old slightly-below-market rents, and use its 'profits' to buy and build more houses. Maybe once non-profit foundations took over the whole rental market they could all drop their prices, that's a few steps away though.

What do people think? I feel like this is the kind of thing the NDP should be putting out there, although any party could do this.

Look, housing prices sky rocketed everywhere across Canada, including many places/towns without any demand/supply foreign buyer zoning concerns at all. Just be careful the Government want to divert your attention to foreign buyers via media or public consulting and actually it's their own failing policies both monetary and fiscal. They can BAN Foreign Ownership in a heartbeat without public consults. They just don't want to ban all they do is to charge them a tiny 1% tip on the bill not so Canadian and it's as cheap/stingy as in foreign owner's own country. You may wanna more housing built or zoning law changes, tell  you the truth foreign buyer wants to. I knew an old Chinese lady retired from Shanghai with good unreported home pension I believe so but in here she lives as low income poor person got extra pension here. She bought 3 units of two-beds room condos. she lives one her kids each lives one right in downtown T.O. Univerisity/Queen/Dundas area. Her kids came back China so rented out maybe. In China you sold just one Unit of two-bed room shitty apartment in Shanghai and many many big cities worth 2 to 3 Millions Canadian DOLLARS so very  EASY to buy property here with that kind of cash several years before even now. Foriegn BAN is a must IMH. This is absolutely No.1 priority to decide who you want in the Government.   

Yes they greatly relieved current homeowners/landlords' from their own mortgage burden in the name of COVID by passing the super heavy 'Mortgage bag' to the young innocent people and future unborn generations, not to mention that trillions of federal/provincial unpaid debts will inevitably for them to be facing with and repay - Sorry a lifelong Debt Slave...YOLO..Eventually Government will let them feeling grateful again by ""offering"" them 50 years' mortgage (which in essence let you own nothing be happy ya!) and bankers will ""help"" them with negative interest rates...sad.

On the other hand, it is the powerless tenants who work very hard some even work two three jobs to  just make ends meet by paying high rents and also contribute paying income taxes, in the mean time covering most of landlords' own already lowered mortgages as well as paying PROPERTY TAXES (even it is not their property) to support local Government's operations. honestly renters are being pushed and burdened to the EXTREME...being sucked dry already. 

Boston ended ""Rent Control Law"" back in 1994, the consequences are that they have huge rental/housing shortage now! Yeah welcome free market that they have wished for and we may wish as well.The tragedy is Boston's current rental price for a one bedroom apartment in the city is up to an average of just over USD$2,800! and it continues to climb from there, with a two-bedroom costing USD$3,500! while a three-bedroom goes on average for just over USD$4,300 a month! Do we want that  price? Or do we want to wait until prices reach that sky high level then ask the Government to react with RENT CONTROL for all?

It will be FAIR and REASONABLE to extend RENT CONTROL to give ALL tenants a little and same level of relief no matter 2018 before or after...and yes if you as Government can give homeowners/landlords big chunk of free juicy ""steaks"" and all renters wants from you are just a piece of free ""little bread"" with or without jams on it be okay not greedy...",CanadaHousing,2021-08-06 18:37:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/ozbjbs/is_it_time_to_request_the_government_to_include/,263

Housing crash imminent,"The current housing situation in Canada is just so absurd that the market must crash to reach sustainable levels. No young people or new immigrants can afford housing anymore. Rents are through the roof, mortgage rates are high, and there still are bidding wars throughout major urban centres. I just don't see how this can be sustainable. I'm seriously considering shorting Canadian bank stocks due to their over exposure to mortgages, a large portion of which will surely default. 

CMHC will be forced to bailout a shitload of these mortgages but will run out of cash completely within the first 6 months. 

I'm bearish on the housing market. I think we will see sub 400K houses in the GTA within 2 years. These rate hikes will be the tipping point that push many homeowners into default. 

The government at all levels is doing nothing meaningful to help the housing situation. All it takes is a mild recession and the market will crash and it will be a significant crash. 

Homelessness rates will go up, the govt will be forced to house more homeless people in hotels and take on debt to finance this. 

The food, gas and housing prices in this country are simply unsustainable. I've been working for over 15 years making decent money and am losing money month over month due to high costs of living. 

If I was a homeowner, I'd sell now and take the profit because in 6 months to a year it will all come crumbling down like a house of cards. Even investors will shy away from real estate investments. 

It doesn't matter that the population reached 40 million. Already many businesses can't hire people because no one can afford housing nearby. 

The Canadian economy is about to experience a massive correction and people will be pissed at the current Liberal govt. But even a future conservative govt will be powerless to help. At least one major Canadian bank will fail, and then it will be a house of cards. 

The key is surviving the next 12-24 months and keeping expenses as low as possible. Once the market crashes it will be possible to buy cheap homes for cash, no mortgage needed. 

The Canadian economy and housing market are both doomed. Mark my words. The status quo is simply unacceptable. Many immigrants will leave.",CanadaHousing,2023-06-19 01:59:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/14d0bt9/housing_crash_imminent/,0
Foreign buyer ban on condos should be lifted to create affordable housing,"This is purely my personal opinions and I would like other people’s inputs.

1. Allow foreign buyers to buy condos only (the ban should be permanent to townhouses and single family houses) to clear the inventories and let them thus those unsold units can be released in the market and more condo rental supplies will be out for public. Foreign money on condos will save developers, and Canadian mom and pop investors simultaneously rent price will go down.

2. Double the developer charges on condo developments plus enforce mandatory donations of public infrastructures such as parks, libraries and schools but reduce it or eliminate for single home family houses, row houses and townhouses. This will stimulate developers to build more livable homes.

3. Let the developers build town and homes in crown land free of charge only in general use area without any fees but make them to bring donations of roads, sewer system, electricity system, water system and only award the development to companies with lowest home selling price. 

4. Tax credit to companies which relocate or start at newly built towns on crown land.

5. Foreign buyer tax (25% of purchasing price) the governments collect should go to Canadian families directly as tax rebate for those of who are buying a home for their family.

Diane Francis: Money laundering by foreigners is what's really destroying housing affordability in Canada - Current proposals to flood the market with new affordable housing or to lift zoning restrictions won’t resolve anything,"https://financialpost.com/diane-francis/money-laundering-by-foreigners-is-whats-really-destroying-housing-affordability-in-canada

Please READ whole article if you have time...very short and to the point...

According to her, this is what Canada must do to drive out dirty money and get prices in line:

— Create a public registry of beneficial owners, and penalties for non-disclosure;

— Lawyers, real estate agents and notaries must report suspicious owners and transactions, as is now required of banks;

—  Speculation must be stopped by taxing residences that are unoccupied, which will also free up supply; and

— Where real estate prices have soared above affordable levels for locals, bans on foreign ownership should be imposed as has been done in New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Greece, Hungary, Denmark, Poland and Malta, among others.


Current proposals by the NDP — to flood the market with new affordable housing — or by conservatives — to lift zoning restrictions — simply won’t move the dial.

This is a fantastic glimpse into Canadian housing on a macro level,"Edit: a little more clarity on why I posted, original post follows

""Starting this year, Canada doesn’t want to just sell and guarantee CMBs. In the 2023 Fall Economic Statement, they announced they’ll also become the buyer. They’ll purchase half of the 5- and 10-year CMBs, up to $30 billion. The government is essentially borrowing money to buy the investments they guarantee, with bonds they also guarantee""

This is what made me post. It's a normal activity to package up these bonds, but we are now borrowing to buy 30 billion $$ of them (because nobody else seems to want them) from ourselves. 75% of this year's deficit spending is the number. 

That doesn't seem like a sound economic policy to me - if these bonds were a good investment, we wouldn't need to ""borrow"" money because non government entities would buy them (investors)

I read it as arguably the most inflated real estate market in the world propping itself up with borrowed money guaranteeing borrowed money guaranteed by us, ultimately. Because we will be footing the bill if anything goes wrong

That's it, I'm out - paying off all debts and saving up cash for a property

TL/DR article is a glimpse in to how the Canadian government will ensure home prices (and by consequence rents) will stay high.

Now it's great news for current home owners, you have time. I don't know what future consequences will be, it amounts to the government propping up our housing market with every Canadian paying for it themselves. 

Ya, whether you rent or buy, you are helping high prices stay.

Perspective of One Landlord,"I know I'm stepping into the Lions Den as I write this but hopefully people understand that it's not ""all tenants bad"" or ""all landlords"" bad. There is nuance and many of us are just trying to do the best by our families. 

My wife and I graduated from Uni together in 2008. We were renters, we understood the difficulty of being a renter and never knowing when you will be evicted. We also wanted a child and didn't want to subject them to this environment. So we put our heads down and saved EVERYTHING for 8 years. No vacations, no fancy cars, cheap phones, very limited going out for food to very budget places on special occasions, buying clothes from Costco, etc. By the end of the 8 years, we had saved just over $100k (I know not a lot in 8 years but it's all we could manage between us). 

In late 2016, we put the 100k down on a $400k townhouse in Langley and soon after had our first child. Things were going well but even at the age of 4, she was so energetic that all the stairs and vertical layout of the townhouse was proving to be a struggle and we wished we could get her a detached home to play in the yard, as we had done when we were children. So we went to our mortgage broker, knowing our townhome had appreciated and that we both had better jobs, hoping we could qualify for a home - and we did, well kinda.

We were given two options: 

1) Stay in Langley and buy a detached home with a rental suite (the only way we could get approved for detached). 

2) Move further out towards Chilliwack and buy a detached home without a tenant. 

We really didn't want to get into the business of being landlords but we also wanted to try and provide our child with a nice home with a yard without having to increase my downtown commute from 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. We went with option one, closed on a cozy home and started looking for a tenant. 

Almost immediately, we get a call from my wife's colleague that her sister is looking for a basement suite in Langley and she would be a great fit. In hindsight we should have done a ton more research into being landlords, looked into potential pitfalls, etc but we interviewed this lady who happened to be a single mom with 3 kids that has been trying to find a home for 3 months. She didn't make all that much but enough to cover under market rent and her credit score being in the 650 range was worrying but we thought we'd do something good and accepted her to give her a chance. We were ok with under market rent because that was enough for us to cover what we needed for our mortgage and we were hoping our home would be shared by a nice person who appreciated it. We signed a 1 year lease. 

Biggest mistake. She stopped paying after 3 months because she was let go from her job. Her kids were insanely loud at all times and we found out later that they got pets without letting us know. When we finally got her out of the unit 4 months later, the floors were trashed, the walls were marked up and even a toilet was broken. We had $30k in damages and the tenant didn't have a cent to her name. 

In our ideal world we can do a fixed term tenancy, agree on a rate and if everything works great renew it as both parties see fit. We wouldn't want to do yearly increases but if it gets really far from market rate then we can discuss with the tenant to moving to about 80% of market. I think that is a fair system and while yes, we wouldn't need the extra to cover the mortgage, we would love to contribute more towards our daughter's education fund. The government has taken away all risk management options for landlords (no fixed term tenancies, long process to get rid of a nonpaying tenant, fixed increases, no retroactive increases etc). The landlord assumes all the risk and has very little recourse outside of a bad faith eviction to get rid of an unpleasant tenant that we share a home with - however the tenant can choose to leave whenever they like once it's month to month.  

Due to this, the only tool left for us are being super picky at the point of starting a tenancy. There are so many applicants that we understand now why everyone is chasing the single professional with a great credit score and no pets making 4x rent because it just makes life so much easier in a scenario where you have little recourse once tenancy begins. If we didn't rely on the rental income to cover our mortgage we honestly wouldn't have tenants once our current amazing tenant moves out - although we hope he stays forever because he is wonderful. 

Think of it this way - it's like immediately having to get married to someone after going on a first date. No dating and seeing how it goes, just jump right in. Someone who may have minor red flags that you might give a chance to date, you might say no way if you have to marry them right away. And this is why the rental application is so invasive. It's not necessarily the landlords or the tenants - there bad actors in both camps. It's government legislation that appears tenant friendly but has the opposite effect in either reducing supply or creating ridiculous hoops for tenants to have to jump through because it's the only think of it this way - it's like immediately having to get married to someone after going on a first date. No dating and seeing how it goes, just jump right in. Someone who may have minor red flags that you might give a chance to date, you might say no way if you have to marry them right away. 

And this is why the rental application is so invasive. It's not necessarily the landlords or the tenants - there bad actors in both camps. It's government legislation that appears tenant friendly but has the opposite effect in either reducing supply or creating ridiculous hoops for tenants to have to jump through because it's the only tool landlords, even reluctant landlords like us, have left to protect ourselves. I will say this as well, I wish there were so much housing supply that prices overall would come down, we wouldn't need tenants and that tenants themselves would be able to buy. But until that happens we're all stuck in this unfortunate system.",CanadaHousing,2024-07-27 01:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/1ed40mb/perspective_of_one_landlord/,0

Hello,

My name is Shawn Benjamin, I am a National TV news field producer at the CBC in Toronto and I’m working up a story for Wednesday June 15th to coincide with the new **Canadian Real Estate Association Report  (CREA)** published that day.

**We want to look beyond the report and put a face to the numbers.**  Maybe some of you here would be interested in talking to me.

Ideally, we are looking for - people who  - after experiencing the wild market of the last two years and are now seeing prices edge lower  -  **are waiting / expecting real estate prices to drop more and hopefully get into the market soonish.**",CanadaHousing,2022-06-10 18:47:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/v9dc5l/cbc_news_is_looking_for_people_waiting_for_a/,157
Would you disagree with corporations owning residential property?,"I've come to terms that I have no power, individually, in enacting enough change to make housing more affordable. But I can't help myself and I keep thinking of what I would consider a strong enough measure to cool housing down.

I'm going to lay out what laws I would put in place, and what I want is you lovely people to tell me how these ideas could possibly impact individuals negatively.

1. No corporation can own any residential property for more than 6 months. Any property that exceeds the 6 months is then transferred to the state to sell off and it must be sold off, not indefinitely possessed by the state.
2. No non-canadian citizen can own more than one (1) property in Canada.
3. The law takes effect until a one bedroom apartment or equivalent property in size and purpose is averagely priced between: annual minimum wage x 1.5 and annual minimum wage x 3. Once this threshold is reached, the laws may be ""put on hold"", with the opportunity to place them in effect again if we have another runaway housing crisis.


Some of you may look at this and consider this way too extreme. Call me crazy, but I personally don't think a one bedroom apartment should cost more than 60K on average. And that's fine if you do. 

Some of you may think this will hurt individual house flippers. I'm gonna be honest, I don't have much sympathy for them.

What I'm mainly looking for is your opinion on how, if at all, this could impact housing affordability in a negative way for individuals who don't currently have access to the housing market.

It's a thought exercise. It is unrealistic, mostly because anyone trying to do something this drastic would find themselves assassinated, and aside from maybe myself, noone would be willing to risk their lives for housing affordability like that. But I find it soothing to think about as friends of mine rent studio apartments for more than their wages can afford.

Is my Dad’s rent fair?,"I (21M) recently had to move 3 hours away to live with my Dad and Stepmom for a job opportunity. He wants me to pay rent for the room I’m staying in. The house is in Amherstburg, Ontario which is a very small town. The place is at least 30 minutes from any major city. It’s in the basement of the house and there’s a bathroom down there that is supposed to be mine though other people are still going to be using it if they are down there in the living space. 

This room was considered a guest bedroom before I moved in and it has been said that if they have company over that wants to stay the night then I will have to take the couch after my 50-60 hour work week of manual labour. I have my own parking spot. I’m going to be paying for all my own food as well. He wants $1000 per month starting in December. At first I didn’t have a huge issue with it but after doing some digging around in the area I’m kinda changing my mind here. I’ve asked people around my work and some think it’s fair and others think the price is ridiculous. 

Online there are places ranging between 500-800 for one room. They said in their “research” and taking into account that I’m family that initially it was going to be $50 a day which is $1500 per month but they thought that was excessive. They are also aware that I’m being completely hosed on my truck insurance at roughly $700 per month. In my mind 700-ish is fair for what I’m getting especially considering the couch thing. 

What say you? I’m trying to get some opinions here before we have another conversation about it. Thanks.

The Dominoes are Beginning to Fall,"Going to keep this as brief as possible. Yes we've experienced a real estate boom in major Canadian cities for decades; however, assets ebb and flow. And it seems to be time for the fall from grace.

* TRREB YoY sales down 27.4%, YoY listings up 76%, YoY average price down 2.2%.

This one does not need to be explained. A surplus of listings will decrease price. I won't waste much time reviewing supply/demand principles.

* Late February data indicates 50% of emigrants are **leaving Ontario**

As milennials age and look to begin roots and families they are looking outside of Ontario. It isn't affordable.

* Both Liberal & Conservative gov'ts intend to lower immigration numbers.

Canada's current immigration strategy is to invite immigrants, inject whatever money they have into our economy, and then wish them luck. This is proving to be problematic as GDP/capita has regressed in something like 8/9 of the past quarters. Less people means less competition for housing.

* Rent prices decreasing.

Landlording will no longer be as lucrative as it once was. Less rental property investors in the markets driving price up.

* Layoffs

Many sectors are seeing layoffs. Tech sector especially but there will be more. Few people will feel secure in their role which means fewer purchases. Other industries that will soon see layoffs are luxury. For example travel, entertainment, etc.

* Pre-Con Market Imploding

I don't have the exact number but in 2025 I believe double the amount of pre-cons are coming to title when compared to any year in the past decade. If you spend anytime scrolling this sub you will see it's a bloodbath. So many people walking away from down payments. These condos will be on market.

* Inflation impacting cost of living

Inflation is eating away at the possibility for many people to buy. An example is a renter that was holding on for a down payment may have to tap into those funds to afford groceries. Everyone's goal post is being moved by rising cost of living.

* No matter how low interest rates go if people do not have down payments they cannot buy.

This point is perhaps the most critical. Real estate speculators insist that lowered interest rates will produce more buyers. This isn't true. Without family help there are limited amounts of people that can afford to enter the market.

tl;dr:

People are leaving Ontario in record numbers, basic supply and demand principles working against real estate market, life is too expensive here, and the prospective buyers cannot afford to purchase regardless of interest rates.",TorontoRealEstate,2025-03-06 00:00:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1j4i2bj/the_dominoes_are_beginning_to_fall/,186
Assuming land was free how much does it cost to build the 2000sqft house every Canadian seems to believe should be cheap if we got rid of investment?,"How about the 1000sqft condo in a concrete highrise as Canadians say it's because of ""investors"" that we build boxes?

Is it realistic that people expect housing development to continue and believe prices should be cut in half to be ""affordable""? Or does it just cost more to build a house than what people can ""afford""?

Do Canadians ignore that worker wages would need to be cut severely to build the housing they deem ""affordable""? Or do they believe we can pay workers the same yet severely cut the price of the product they produce? Or, and this is my personal belief, do they know we'd have to slash wages but don't want to directly say that and rather pretend it's the boss/investors/bank that takes the loss.

Sometimes it feels like certain Canadians can be complete morons as they scream about investors and foreigners to avoid the truth that it costs money to build something and investors just lead to more rental housing that decreases rent, it's not like that housing unit they buy would magically get built without their money.

Inflation is at 2%. Interest rates go down, housing goes up, but wages are still stagnant, there still isn't enough housing and people still can't actually afford houses or even an increase in rent.

Even at say 2% the interest on a million dollars is 20k a year + tax and all that and youre over 2k a month in interest/taxes + principal and these are gonna keep going up with wages stagnating? Do speculators really come back? Median Canadians literally cannot afford over 3k a month in rent, and there just won't be enough units, are we just gonna hit a massive homelessness wall? Doesn't this also necessitate a recession by virtue of renters literally spending their entire paycheck on rent?

Would the mania spin up again or has inflation and interest finally come back to bite everyone and the massive growth in population and decline in gdp per capita force housing prices to go down.

Or we end up 4 to a room? I just don't see how boomers sell their houses for the 3 million they want in richmond hill or whatever. We're talking hundreds of thousands of units that are going to want to be sold over the next decade for millions each but where does the money come from?

Is there room for another decade of kicking the can, or are we at the end of the line here?

People talk about how these million dollar properties will be 2 million in 10 years and its like but hoooow, how can anyone pay for that, how can this happen without inflation, like the money has to exist for that and that much more money necessitates inflation which necessitates rates above 2% which means rents can't cover mortgage intere- oh no I've gone cross eyed.",TorontoRealEstate,2024-07-20 22:54:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1e86ni9/im_trying_to_imagine_the_ideal_bull_scenario_and/,13
Can someone help me understand if buying a condo is a good move or bad,"My family and I have saved up a fair bit of money. I was wondering if it would make sense to buy a condo in DT Toronto for 600-700k, with around 0.8 fees for.  1 + den

The reasoning is around instead of paying the money in rent which is 2325 with utilities i can instead put the money in asset so that I can save that money after the maintenance fees and then if i leave the place my parents can live in the place unless my family chooses to live with me. 

The idea that we pass the place for 10-15 years then sell.

No mortgages just pay for the house in full and try to allocate the extra money into an investment for with good liquidity in the long run. So in both scenarios the invested money + asset will yield more value overtime for some nice equity.

From what i was hoping the housing market is not good and people overpaid for shit boxes but if one buys a place built to be live able it will appreciate in value and reduce spending over time for rent.

Is my reasoning wrong or am i missing something?",TorontoRealEstate,2025-03-25 03:12:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1jj9ynf/can_someone_help_me_understand_if_buying_a_condo/,11
Math and my opinion behind the 25 to 30 year mortgage change and what it might mean for markets.,"The below is a personal opinion and is based on a few assumptions that may be a bit off due to me being lazy/sloppy: current lowest fixed rate is 4.1%, lowest fixed rate during pandemic is 3.5% in Feb 2022 before rates began rising (I realize unadvertised rates went lower especially the variable rates). I'm also assuming people focus on monthly payments rather than overall mortgage, especially as they tend to compare monthly rent to mortgage. Edit: to add, most numbers came from a quick google search and could be off, feel free to edit in your head.

For a million dollar mortgage it's a change from $4267 to $3865 with 20% down. In comparison a rate of 3.1% would get you $3835. So basically this represents nearly a 1% drop in interest on monthly payments.

The lowest rate during the pandemic was 3.5% (Edit: it's been pointed out it went down to almost 2.0%). So this represents a rate lower than the pandemic (Edit: at least lower than the posted rates, probably the 4.1% will go down \~0.5% in a few weeks due to the recent cuts so it balances out somewhat). But will this result in a covid housing boom? Perhaps. For one thing this only applies to new builds or new buyers for homes under $1.5 mil. However, what people don't realize is a new buyer is not necessarily a new buyer. There is a period of time where this status can reset (which I myself am waiting for as I cosigned my moms mortgage).

Another factor is that people go by rent payments to price. Rents have skyrocketed since Feb 2022 with rents only going down somewhat recently. Thus since covid rents are higher than before. In comparison, home prices spiked in mid 2022 after rates starting coming up, then tanked to below their covid high.

[https://wolfstreet.com/2024/01/15/the-most-splendid-housing-bubbles-in-canada-nationally-18-in-december-from-peak-toronto-20-even-in-calgary-house-prices-dropped-end-of-easy-money/](https://wolfstreet.com/2024/01/15/the-most-splendid-housing-bubbles-in-canada-nationally-18-in-december-from-peak-toronto-20-even-in-calgary-house-prices-dropped-end-of-easy-money/)

So not considering the economy and just going by monthly payments versus rent, this change represents payments going down more than during the covid boom while rent is up higher than during the boom. However, there are obviously a lot of other factors at play than the simple mortgage payment versus rent equation.

For one is the median income. This seems to never matter in our market but hey let's consider it here. The median person makes $67k before tax (Edit: it's been pointed out other sources say lower). Let's make that $134k gross. A 30 year mortgage should have 6 years as the down payment so 134k with a 40% tax rate, $80,400 and 30% of after tax income saved for a down payment\*6 years=$144,720.

Maximum purchase price in Ontario: $688k. Mortgage $2620 a month. That assumes no extra expenses.  
The average purchase price in Ontario is $879k  
[https://wowa.ca/ontario-housing-market](https://wowa.ca/ontario-housing-market)

So we are definitely getting closer but the median person is not buying the average home. What is interesting to consider is the average rent in Ontario is $2351. On a $688k home the interest would be $2351/month at 4.1%. Somehow they are exactly even, what a coincidence. So we're now break even between renting or a mortgage, but that obviously doesn't consider the cost of maintenance, depreciation or property tax on the home. So it seems like owning will make sense if mortgage rates come down just a little more or rents go up. With the recent 0.5% rate cut we may see mortgage rates come down even more, especially if they cut 0.25 in spring.

My personal opinion based on what we saw during covid and the math is that buying will began to make sense for a lot of renters in Spring 2025 with the bottom of the market seeing large demand as buying becomes more profitable than renting. Whether we also see strong activity for homes above $688k isn't supported by the math, but is supported by logical inference given what we have seen before.",TorontoRealEstate,2024-12-15 19:26:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1heyt5g/math_and_my_opinion_behind_the_25_to_30_year/,23
Foreign born as a % by metro area in North America,"I have no desire to stir up anti-minority hatred or something. But Canadians really need to stop being idiots and blaming the rich/developers/money laundering/all the other stupid things. The BC NDP brought in 10+ taxes blaming all these stereotypes not backed up by any facts (or reality) and prices and rents went up not down. That’s right the party that claimed it’s behind workers/renters significantly drove up rent and prices making Vancouver the most expensive city in Canada. The fact is if you don’t build enough housing and you drop 500k+ people into two cities every year you are going to have a crisis. So either we spread out immigration, build more housing in those concentrated areas, or decrease immigration.",TorontoRealEstate,2023-12-01 16:04:16,https://i.redd.it/7srq7p9r7p3c1.jpg,32
Realistic summary of where Canadian real estate is likely headed,"I noticed that this and other forums (looking at you Canadahousing) have descended into an us vs. them kinda situation.

I thought I'd try and add a realistic summary of what's going on from the point of view of someone who keeps an eye on global economic and monetary trends and has been investing in the stock market for a few years now. Here is a high-level summary of how we got here and where we are likely headed (my opinion only). I am not bullish on real estate, the stock market or the economy in general.

1. We started off pre-pandemic with an acknowledged housing bubble in certain cities in Canada (primarily Vancouver and Toronto)
2. Interest rates being low since 2008 were a driving force coupled with an unwillingness by anyone in government to tackle the very obvious speculation and money laundering in real estate. MPs like Taleeb and even our current housing (and diversity?) minister (Hussein) actively had and continue to have multiple fingers in multiple housing pies. The government encouraged speculation and enjoyed the 'paper growth' it added to the GDP. You didn't need hindsight to see that this was a bad idea.
3. A 20 year bull cycle in Canadian real estate (particularly in Vancouver and the GTA) coupled with a lack of government action to address speculation led to excessive confidence among buyers and investors who confidently declared (and continue to do so) that 'RE in Canada only goes up'. Canada was spared the lessons of 2008 that US real estate investors experienced. The main lesson of the 2008 crisis was that real estate does crash and it tends to crash very badly when it does.
4. Interestingly, we saw a slight decline in some cities around 2017-2018 as interest rates crept up a bit and some foreign buyer taxation was passed (in Vancouver anyway). However, the government continued to ignore that a large part of speculative demand was driven by domestic investors. They still pretend like this isn't happening. The supply that is starting to show up is proving there are more domestic 'investors' than they wanted to acknowledge.
5. It's 2020 and Covid arrived. No one saw it coming. Asset classes started to dive but central banks around the world decided to lower interest rates to nearly 0 and proceeded to lend copious amounts of money to governments. The great everything bubble is born.
6. Inflation arises and the exact cause is hotly debated. Personally, I believe it was a combination of low interest rates, excessive cheap debt and speculation in certain asset classes coupled with real world supply chain and logistics issues. I don't believe inflation will go away for a long, long time. I think it will take minimum 2-3 years and possibly longer if they don't raise rates high enough or decide to pause/reduce before the data shows that inflation has been properly dealt with. Inflation is as much psychological as it is a physical aspect of prices.
7. 2022, we get a war in Ukraine - the world's 'breadbasket'. No one saw it coming. I didn't even know they were the world's breadbasket until the war. As it turns out, this war is bad news for everyone and it arrives at a time when economies worldwide are still on their knees from the global pandemic shock. Now we have to deal with an energy crisis and a foodgrain crisis in the VERY NEAR future.
8. Together, inflation and the war exacerbate the problem of supply and affordability. Prices go up and we are now headed towards serious shortages worldwide coupled with inflating prices in certain key commodities. Several countries have begun to ban exports of critical commodities (like wheat and foodgrains). The impact of this is YET to be felt.
9. The US Federal Reserve have realized their error and have begun to raise rates. They realize they were too slow to address inflation (it wasn't 'transitory' after all) and have lost a lot of credibility. Bond rates reflect this and forced their hand too. The US Feds understand that if they lose more credibility, the US dollar begins to lose its status as a reliable world currency and store of value. They must aggressively rein in inflationary expectations and keep the value of the USD fairly stable. This is good for international trade and business (which the US and every nation ultimately depends on today).
10. At the same time, owing to massive government debt burdens and inflated asset classes (stocks, housing and some commodities), rising rates pose a problem for heavily indebted businesses, individuals and governments. 20 years of increasing stimulus is hard to wean off.

This is the situation we are in now. If central banks don't forcefully address inflation by raising rates, the idea that everything is getting more expensive will become embedded into people's everyday expectations. Can you imagine if the cost of everyday goods that has seen a sudden price increase in the last 12 months doubles by this time next year? How will you react? Will you buy more or save your money in expectation of future expenses?

This is also why we are undoubtedly heading into the worst recession of our lifetimes. Put aside your bullish or bearish bias and consider how many unprecedented shocks the entire global system has endured over the last 3 years. During this time, asset classes have inflated when everything should have been logically contracting. The reason is simple - they borrowed heavily from the future (or from thin air if you prefer to think of it that way) to stabilize an unsteady situation. Instead of the money being used to support and grow local economies in a productive manner, people and businesses used it to speculate on assets (people overleveraged on housing and businesses on share buybacks, corporate bonuses, etc.). Obviously, there was little or no growth generated to compensate for these temporarily cheap loans.

Now, central banks and governments have to choose - do they sacrifice the asset bubbles and allow the system to reset in a healthy if painful way or keep playing the cheap debt game and watch the problem get bigger until it explodes in an unpredictable way in the not very distant future. If it wasn't for Covid and all that followed, they could have possibly kept the system going for a lot longer. They weren't counting on this 'black swan event' from disrupting a fragile system.

**Outcomes:**

House prices are going down. This is going to shock many people because all we've witnessed for 20 years is housing go up (in Canada anyway).

It doesn't matter if you paid $1 million for your townhouse in Scugog or Mission or wherever - it was never really worth $1 million anyway. The hope that this ponzi scheme (that is what it essentially is, just official and endorsed) will continue indefinitely makes 0 sense. Housing is tied to the stability of local economies and the cost of housing (buying or renting) directly impacts how much money people have left over to spend on other areas of the economy. Surely, even the least financially educated person must realize that housing is a non-productive asset ultimately. If allowed to inflate so far beyond affordability to the point where even renting isn't an option for a sizebale chunk of your population, your economy is going to die.

The stock market is going down. This is already playing out in real time. We may see short rallies but ultimately, a bear market is setting in. Stocks are far more liquid than houses so we see moves in this asset class before we see it in housing. It has already begun in the US. Pay attention to how it plays out there. It has also already begun here in Canada and will continue to spiral downwards.

We are headed into the worst recession of our lifetime. There are simply no precedents for the situation we find ourselves in (not just Canada, but all countries globally). Things have never looked so bleak and the confidence being feigned by governments and central banks are a facade. They are frightened as they rightfully should be.

Why do so many people who represent regular retail believe that they know more than billionaires and smart money? Many very successful businessmen (Grantham, Dalio, Burry to name just 3) as well as several noted economists have all being saying for some time now that things are about to get much worse than people expect.

The people who have seen their assets inflate want to believe that the gravy train will keep going. It's human nature - I'm winning and why won't my pile of money keep getting bigger forever? But this time things really are different. It's going to hurt asset class owners as much as it has everyone else. The heavily overleveraged are about to suffer the worst.

Final note - this sort of turmoil tends to lead to unpredictable outcomes. We didn't see covid coming, we didn't see the Ukraine war and we didn't see inflation arising. Yet, everyone thinks it will be smooth sailing from here? I think things are going to get much worse before they get any better. Things could play out smoothly - they could (magically) get inflation under control in 6 months but try and think logically about everything that has led to where we are and all the other unexpected surprises along the way - do you really believe everything is going to move smoothly from here?

**Edit:** I forgot to add - The BoC is also about to embark on QT (Quantitative Tightening) for the first time in its history. This is the opposite of QE and is just one more factor to keep an eye on. Added link for anyone interested in reading more: [https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-eye-uncharted-waters-quantitative-tightening-looms-canada-2022-02-09/](https://www.reuters.com/business/investors-eye-uncharted-waters-quantitative-tightening-looms-canada-2022-02-09/)  


Also, the number of emotional reactions should tell you just how much of this bubble was driven by sentiment. It was all good when it was ballooning skywards but now when the data is showing the opposite, hard to swallow. Good luck to all - those who own or those who are waiting to buy.

Is Canada Propping up Condo Investors to Prevent Prices From Falling? By John Pasalis,"[https://www.movesmartly.com/articles/is-canada-propping-up-condo-investors-to-prevent-prices-from-falling](https://www.movesmartly.com/articles/is-canada-propping-up-condo-investors-to-prevent-prices-from-falling)

While most media headlines regarding Toronto’s condo market have focused on the [record number of units listed for sale](https://www.movesmartly.com/articles/record-number-of-condos-for-sale-in-the-toronto-area), there is a bigger and more troubling risk that few have considered. Many of the newly completed condominiums in Toronto are not worth what investors paid, which raises an important question.

Are Canadian policymakers and financial institutions artificially supporting investors to prevent condo prices from collapsing? I believe they are, and I think this problem will only get worse in the years ahead... 

...

Where we go from here depends heavily on our government’s policies and approach to handling the problematic conditions ahead. 

Policymakers can continue doing what they have been doing, encouraging banks to break Canada’s banking regulations to support the bad investment decisions of this small sub-class of real estate investors. This would avoid a broader systemic crisis of condo projects failing due to too many buyers defaulting on their purchases.

If newly completed condo projects begin to fail, the negative consequences and economic side effects would be significant.

While policymakers have some control over managing the overpriced new condominiums that will be completed in the years ahead, they have far less control over what happens in the resale market, which currently has a record number of units available for sale. The future direction of condominium prices in the resale market in the short term is largely out of our government’s control.

If condo inventory continues to increase, we could see some downward pressure on condo prices, further widening the gap between resale prices and the prices pre-construction condo investors paid for their units. 

To mitigate this risk, our government could reverse its plans to reduce the number of non-permanent residents in Canada over the next three years. If the federal government follows through with its plans, Canada’s population will go from growing by just under 1.3 million to approximately 300,000 people annually. This dramatic decrease may contribute to future downward pressure on condo prices and rents.

But if our government wants to keep condo prices and rents as high as possible to mitigate the potential negative side effects of the overpriced condos scheduled to be completed in the years ahead, it may reverse course on these plans. Extending Canada’s current population boom isn’t guaranteed to drive prices and rents higher, but at a minimum, it would help raise the floor of any declines. 

Finally, buyers and sellers in Toronto’s housing market will want to keep a close eye on the trends I highlighted above because it’s unclear how far policymakers will go to keep prices from falling. I would encourage readers to subscribe to our Move Smartly blog here and our [Move Smartly YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MoveSmartly), where I frequently discuss trends that might influence their real estate decisions.",TorontoRealEstate,2024-08-13 03:53:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1eqx64o/is_canada_propping_up_condo_investors_to_prevent/,67
How do my numbers look on a rental property?,"I'm a Canadian citizen living in the US and looking to buy a house in Toronto as a rental and eventually move in there in 3-5 years.

Would appreciate feedback on my numbers:

**Purchase price: 1.3M**

**Downpayment: 507k**

**Closing costs/tax: $47,650**

**Mortgage: $792,770**

**Rate: 5.1%**

**PITI: $5,338**

**Expected rent: $5,000**

**Monthly net: –$338**

I understand I'm carrying at a loss but this is still cheaper in the end than the 3% annual property inflation, and that seems like a tame estimate compared to what will happen when rates go lower.

Other questions

1. Do I have to pay any withholding tax as a non-resident, since I'm net negative? Or do I get money back?
2. What should I budget monthly for an on-call type of property manager or overall maintenance?
3. Any other considerations?

Capital Gains tax is just a way for the government to monetize from their uncontrolled immigration,"It's ridiculous that the government is calling this a ""tax"". It's just a way for them to make money off the problem they created. 

1. Bring in 500,000 newcomers and 300,000 students per year in the middle of a housing crisis
2. Canadians buy rental properties to rent out to to these newcomers and take more housing supply away from the market
3. House prices continue to increase significantly due to uncontrolled immigration and lack of housing supply
4. The government makes a huge profit on the home when it's sold for more money

Instead of focusing on building more homes and reducing immigration - problems that *they* created, they are choosing to profit off their own housing crisis.

Buying a tenanted property as the end user ,"Thinking about putting in an offer on a detached home, to be occupied by us. 

To my knowledge the tenants have only been there a couple years. Is it realistic to think that tenants will leave before closing in this rental environment? Obviously, we would request the house be vacant on close as a condition. We are fine with a long closing date (ie 90 days).

I understand that tenanted properties are less competitive due to the risk of them not leaving/going to LTB and dragging the process out. However, we might be able to negotiate a more reasonable price. 

Do you think it’s worth the risk to wait until closing only to walk away if the tenants don’t leave? I’m worried that bc rents are very high right now, they will fight tooth and nail to not leave.

My take on what's coming fast towards us (plus a rant about Realtors),"This has two sections...

1) Why you should NOT take advice from Realtors, and

2) Where we the people in Canada are heading with residential property

**Realtor Advice**

I replied to a post in this sub-reddit about the insane prices for condos in Toronto, and a realtor popped in and basically stated that the prices are fine if you are a long term user of that property. To me, that premise is insane for one reason.

(This is the post  https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1gjhlba/downtown\_toronto\_condo\_prices\_in\_oct\_2024\_by/)

If you have to sign a mortgage for that much money, you are literally committing yourself to a life of servitude as you will probably never get out from under that debt.

Forget holidays. Forget having nice things. Your sole purpose is to serve your debt, just so you can be assured you wont get left out on the street in winter to die.

Just be happy that the person who owned this before you, is now all cashed up thanks to you.

Is this reasonable? Is this not insane?

**What's coming for us**  


No one can say they know 100% for sure what's going to happen. But let me make a few salient points.

1) There is a gray wave coming. The boomers will die - this is a fact. Its starting to happen now, and will get bigger as time passes

2) Large corporate entities want to own all the properties. They already know everything about every property, about the owners including their personal financial position. They know everything, and you the ""house flipper"", will not be able to compete in the very near future. If you really think you can beat systems built on A.I. then you are in fact an idiot.

3) We live in Canada, where being homeless can mean a death sentence in winter. Politicians need to wake TFU, and pass laws to remove housing as an investment vehicle for corporations. The only idea I have for this is that every citizen or permanent resident is allowed to own one (1) residential property at a time. A husband/wife could own one home, and a holiday home. New homes built by corporations could be owned for a set period of time, before they must be sold to a citizen or permanent resident

4) And if corporations want to own multiple properties, then they must agree to rent controls

**Summary**

To those folks who made fortune on property. Corporations with A.I. is coming for you next. You are not smart. You are not beating the odds. The corporations will win, and **you and your kids will be happy owning nothing.**

To those folks who didn't ride the property wave, I say this. Vote like your life depends on it. Property owners vote. They vote for governments that wont tax them properly on their investments. They vote to pass the costs onto you. They do not care if you end up in a tent under a bridge. And they **DO NOT** get that they (and their kids) are the next targets for the corporations, as the money has now been sucked from all the poor, and its their turn next.

And to all my Canadian brothers and Sisters. We need to stand on guard for each other. What's coming is bad, and its going to hurt us all. Left, right and the middle.

1. Low GDP for the foreseeable future
2. Lower Canadian Dollar (results in higher inflation)
3. Unemployment is going to get worse
4. Stagnant Building starts. 

Lets stand on guard for each other, and demand that our politicians actually do something that makes sense for all Canadians and not do dumb shit like this which only keeps the bubble afloat for just a little bit longer (or the next election):

Dumb idea # 1 - raise the insured mortgage cap to $1,5000,000.00 for up to 30 years

Dumb idea # 2 - offer insured mortgages up to $2,000,000.00 if it includes a basement suite.

Dumb idea # 3 - Bring in stacks of temporary foreign workers with little to no skills so the likes of Tim Hortons and Dairy Queen can get cheap labor.

Oh, and my twinkie bet for the next Bank of Canada meeting = 50 basis point cut.

Enter “Canadian home prices” into a Google search and you’ll find endless headlines about real estate imploding.

That, and 13-year highs in [mortgage rates](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-mortgages-canada-fixed-variable-explainer/), have driven countless homebuyers to the sidelines. And many are now licking their chops, hoping to buy closer to the bottom.

To do that takes market timing. Most experts discourage timing for good reason. Gauging price direction can be a crapshoot.

Take the most widely used metric of prices in Canada, for example, the Canadian Real Estate Association’s average home price. The country’s average price has skidded 18.4 per cent from February’s peak, and likely 20 per cent-plus once July numbers come out midmonth.

But averages are misleading. More on that in a minute.

### Buying some time

If you’re a prospective [home buyer](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/), you probably want to know when it’s safe to go back in the water.

I’ll give you some clues and a caveat. The caveat is, I’m not a fortune teller and don’t pretend to be a home price timer.

The clues that follow are legit, however, and their turning points will coincide with a bottom in most cases.

### Prices in your region

As mentioned above, average home prices can’t be relied on, particularly at the national level.

If you see the average price plummet, you have to dig deeper. Are similar types of homes (four-bedroom two-storeys, for example) selling for less? Or are people simply buying more apartment condos, which drags down the average price?

The latter is a major factor right now as steep mortgage rates slash buying power. Economists call it the “composition effect.”

Average prices are also deceptively high because they’re constantly skewed by high-end sales. A bunch of $3-million-plus home sales can prop up average prices. But when people stop buying $3-million-plus homes, average prices can dive. Again, with [mortgages harder to qualify for](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-interest-rates-variable-mortgage-explained/), we’re seeing this trend now.

Median prices are a far better gauge of true price action but they still suffer from compositional effects, albeit much less than average prices. Problem is, it’s impossible to find median price data nationwide.

CREA doesn’t publish the data owing to restrictions from certain real estate boards. Hopefully this changes some day.

In the meantime, if you’re in Ontario or British Columbia, use a site like HouseSigma for median prices. It even projects median prices well before official data are released.

Since median data are unavailable in most regions, people have to rely on home price indexes (HPIs), which you can get from CREA, Teranet and RPS Real Property Solutions. HPIs compare similar types of homes, which makes price comparisons far more accurate.

[CREA’s version](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/) is solid because it’s based on sales in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), even if those sales haven’t closed yet. Hence, it’s as timely an HPI as you can get.

Tip: Check your [local real estate board’s](https://myrealpage.com/real-estate-boards/) HPI because most publish local data one to two weeks before CREA.

HPIs such as CREA’s let you get granular, showing prices of the home type and location you’re shopping for – condos in Regina, for example.

For signs of a price bottom, you want the HPI in your region to at least start going sideways, potentially auguring a reversal upward.

### Home sales

Home sales lead prices and sales have been plunging thanks to soaring rates and buyer uncertainty. In many cases, sellers are [pulling listings](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-more-homeowners-cancelling-listings-turning-homes-into-rentals-as/) because they’re not getting anywhere near their asking price.

What you want to see is home sales at least starting to flatten out. Check your local real estate board as it publishes this data monthly.

### Inventories

When homes don’t sell, inventories pile up. As the number of homes for sale builds, people get more desperate and cut their prices. Some pull their home off the market altogether.

Fortunately in most regions, CREA suggests that people aren’t panic listing. But let’s see what happens in the fourth quarter or early next year.

Ideally you want to see inventory growth slow meaningfully, or pull back. Again, you can get this data from real estate boards and CREA.

### Unemployment

Most people don’t have to sell, so long as they have a job and can make their payments. Housing capitulation generally requires a surge in job losses and currently, Canada has a record low [unemployment rate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-unemployment-rate-fell-to-record-low-in-june-despite-losing/) of 4.9 per cent.

Thing is, our strong job market won’t last forever. If bond market predictions are right, we’re less than 18 months away from [recession](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/recession/). By the traditional two quarters of negative GDP measure, the United States is already in one.

To monitor unemployment, check [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028701) monthly. It’ll take at least a half-percentage-point jump in unemployment to start driving job-related forced sales and much more than a half-point for a true crash.

Just remember, it can take months for rising unemployment to translate to home selling.

### A turn in rates

If you’re a sideline buyer waiting for your big chance, you’ll want to see:

1. A signal from the Bank of Canada that it’s done hiking rates – which could happen by next year if our uninvited guest, inflation, decelerates meaningfully.
2. A continued drop in Canada’s five-year bond yield
3. The bond market pricing in rate cuts in the next 12 to 18 months

By the time these three things happen, much of the selling driven by rising rates will have ended.

**Final point:** I speak with lots of liquid real estate investors and most are just waiting to snap up bargains, especially given soaring rents and immigration-fed population growth.

Every serious buyer who is on the sidelines right now is watching these very same clues. If you’re a prospective buyer, you should, too.

And if you misread these indicators and mistime your purchase, it’s okay so long as you have a long-term time horizon. It may take two, five or 10 years, but in the long-run, real estate values always grow.

### Rates this week

Despite five-year bond yields tumbling 80 basis points from the June peak, banks are still holding out on lowering their uninsured five-year fixed rates.

Bankers I talk to attribute this to perceived credit risk in the funding markets, illiquidity and volatility (which affect funding and hedging costs) and static competition (banks don’t have to move if other banks aren’t moving).

Meanwhile, the country’s lowest insured five-year fixed rates are down 40 basis points from their 4.84 per cent peak in July.",TorontoRealEstate,2022-08-08 19:25:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/wjg6gj/where_is_the_bottom_for_gta_real_estate/,26
Is housing really that expensive compared to other assets?,"I found this link on another subreddit:
https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2021/03/13/bought-for-19000-sold-for-more-than-2-million-this-don-mills-home-is-a-reminder-of-when-canada-helped-canadians-house-themselves.html

Basically a Toronto house sold for $19k in 1959, and then for $2 million now (2021). People are saying this is crazy because $19k in 2021 dollars (inflation adjusted) is only $171k.

But houses are not just money, they're also an asset. So the proper way would be to compare it to other assets, such as equities.

If you had of invested $19k USD into the S&P500 in 1959, you'd currently be sitting on [$7.8 million USD dollars](https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1959?amount=19000&endYear=2021). I realize that's not Canadian dollars but the currency [was near parity for most of that time](https://www.cclgroup.com/docs/default-source/en/en-strategic-exchange/brief-history-of-the-canadian-dollar.pdf?sfvrsn=ecc82fc8_4).

I interviewed at an Asset Management firm - private equity is outbidding you,"Hi Toronto Real Estate, 

I interviewed recently at an Asset Management firm based in Calgary, but active in the Ontario market. Asset management and private equity firms raise capital from institutional investors and hire people like me (I turned down the job, couldn’t ethically get on board as I myself don’t even own a home) to be a business development rep. The job of the rep is to help raise capital, and to search for properties to buy in order to rent and eventually sell at a profit. Properties include residential houses, condo buildings, and agricultural land. 

I was sickened by the fact that institutional investors are able to outcompete average citizens. On this particular company’s website it stated that “40% of the Canadian public doesn’t qualify for affordable housing, but cannot afford to buy, that’s where we come in”. Basically trying to put a positive spin on the whole thing. This is who is driving up prices. They are the ones willing to pay so much over asking because they’re competing against other firms, not individuals. 

Don’t ask me to name the firm, I don’t want to risk getting in hot water. Please look up asset management and private equity firms with real estate holdings in Canada and call your MPs to complain about what they’re doing. It’s major players that are profiting and when the tide turns and they begin to exit it will be average citizens who’ll be stuck dealing with the crash.",TorontoRealEstate,2021-04-07 15:37:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/mm3j1o/i_interviewed_at_an_asset_management_firm_private/,92
Where interest rates are headed - and the factors that will determine where they go,"Here's a breakdown of some of the factors that will have an impact on rates and what the BoC's “higher for longer” might mean.

***CPI***

The CPI definitely has it’s flaws but it’s what the Bank of Canada uses as one of the metrics to decide whether to cut or hike. The latest **October CPI reading was 3.1%** which is down from 3.8%. From these numbers it looks like things are already headed in the right direction and the rate hikes are working (according to this metric). One thing to consider is that these numbers also contain inflation, which is the direct result of elevated rates. If you remove mortgage interest costs from the calculation, the numbers come down quite a bit. In the latest October report, StatsCan said mortgage interest costs, food and rent were the largest contributors to elevated inflation.

**CPI Without Mortgage Interest Costs:**

July: 2.4% (3.3% with mortgage interest)

August: 3.2% (4% with mortgage interest)

September: 2.9% (3.8% with mortgage interest)

October: 2.2% (3.1% with mortgage interest)

You can see that the rate increases have been much more effective than it seems. These numbers may need to come down more but the goal is in sight if data keeps moving in this direction. It could take up to 24 months to see the full effect of rate hikes in the economy and we are approaching that point. It’s been about 20 months since the first rate hike took place in March of 2022.

***Unemployment***

Unemployment is rising little by little with the latest reading at 5.7% in September up from 5.5% in the previous month. It's now back to the same level it was before the pandemic in March of 2020. You could see this as a sign that BoC is getting what they want out of unemployment numbers.

***Mortgage Delinquencies***

Reports of power of sales are rising on higher priced real estate. There are now over 200 active power of sale listings on TREB. That’s about 400% more than usual. CMHC also released a report that said there are visible upticks in delinquencies in mortgages over $850,000. This probably won’t be much of a concern but it does tell us the pressure is on home owners.

***Lower Rents***

Throughout the country we're starting to see a slight dampening of rents, especially on the larger dwelling side. In Toronto, 3 bedroom rents which reached near $3,800 for the last few months have come down to around $3,600. In Vancouver we're seeing a similar story play out where 3 bedroom rents were reaching $4,500 and have now come down just below $4,000. This will put even more pressure on mortgage payments if rates stay elevated and rents continue to decline. We haven’t seen too much in the 1 and 2 bedroom, rents there have been stable for the last few months.

***Mortgage Renewals in 2025-2026***

The housing market was burning hot in 2020 and 2021 and the cheap money made a $600,000+ mortgage seem cheap. A huge percentage of mortgages originated during this time will be coming up for renewal in 2024, 2025 and 2026. In 2024 and 2025, up to 2.2 million mortgage borrowers will be renewing, representing 45 per cent of all outstanding Canadian mortgages.

***Builders Are Not Building***

You can throw all the government incentives you want at the problem but at the end of the day, the only thing that will get builders to start building with confidence again is lower rates. Builders are in it for the profits and they won’t build something that they can’t sell. The cost of capital is the major factor here. Higher mortgage rates have a direct impact on builder confidence.

According to a report by Altus Group, 245,100 people are expected to retire from construction jobs over the length of 10 years. This is 20% of the construction workforce. Recruiting into these fields is a big challenge, this means labour input will continue to be expensive even as growth is slowing.

***Banks Are Decreasing Their Fixed Rates***

This week, 2,3,4, and 5 year fixed rates at some of the major banks came down in response to the bond market’s reaction to some of the data we mentioned above. The bond market is signaling that it may be time for rates to come down and it seems like the banks are listening.

***South Of The Border***

Inflation there has been trending down for last few months with the latest reading at 3.2%, down from 3.7%. If the U.S. cuts rates, you can bet Canada will most likely do the same. The prevailing theory there seems to be rate cuts by May 2024.

***The Liberals Will Try To Be Re-Elected***

As futile as that sounds, the liberals may attempt to keep floating the housing market through government policies as we have already been seeing such as pushing banks to provide negative or longer amortizations. Housing is nearly 40% of Canada's GDP, politically, they can't afford to let it just die. The majority of that comes from 2 cities: Vancouver and Toronto. What happens to real estate in these cities has a large impact. In those two places, the situation is only going to get worse once mortgages renew in the next 2 years.

***What Does This Mean For Real Estate?***

Even if rates come down, that doesn’t mean home prices will all of a sudden skyrocket. The situation in the housing market right now is one where many over leveraged home owners and investors are just holding on hoping for the rate cuts to happen. A slightly cheaper mortgage payment may only be a vitamin instead of a pain-killer for negative cash flows. We probably won’t see any substantial financial pain until mid 2024 and 2025.

***In Conclusion***

There are a lot of factors calling for some rate cuts but not enough to warrant anything substantial which may jeopardize weakening our currency and releasing inflation. Higher for longer may mean something in the 4% BoC range and maybe longer could mean 3 to 4 years.

"Lessons from Sydney, Australia","Holy shit you Canadians love your real estate. You guys have a dedicated sub where the bears and bulls fight off in every single thread - it’s wild. In Aus, people froth property and it’s the main topic of discussion but not to this extent! 

I’ve seen a bunch of commentary on this sub and thought I’d provide insight on how some of the factors that are discussed may impact prices by using the Sydney market as an example.

1. Variable rates moving to fixed will spike supply - False.

Australia has some of the highest variable rate home loans in the world. There was a huge media scare campaign mid year 2023 where the ‘peak’ of our fixed rates were going to roll into variable. This proved to be nothing but hot air. I assume the Canadian market or Toronto In this instance will show similar resistance.

Those who NEED to sell will have sales plans in the pipeline and those who do not, do not. Also, those who need to sell are doing so in a supply constricted market which means their distressed sale is easily absorbed unless it’s a shithole.

2. Infill, established suburbs will continue ripping while greenfield estates will not.

I don’t know about Toronto’s geography but in Sydney, our city limits are defined by national park in the south and mountains in the north west, we’re land constrained. This has seen land everywhere appreciate and continue to appreciate. In Melbourne, which has land to expand, the further you get away from the city, the lower your land prices get and therefore your prices.

3. Supply and demand is everything.
Detached dwellings are in structural decline in Sydney and are therefore more scarce in nature which ultimately means higher prices, this is not the case for condos unless in highly desirable areas or unless they have unique characteristics. Not sure if this is the case in Toronto as well. Structural decline of listings plus record immigration is a great cocktail for price growth.

The supply of detached housing in Sydney was greater in 2012 when our population was about 30% lower.

4. Rents have shot up and
Yields are currently low but staying stable with rising house prices, this helps keep investors in our market. I suspect Toronto will be facing this similar dynamic which again is a price stabiliser/lifter in the face of higher rates.

5.  Chinese buyers are back and willing to splash the cash.

6. Multi-generational households are competing for stock - more common approach in SE Asian cultures but this is a reality that will drive up prices in the long term where those communities exist.

7. Prices have risen 10% in 2023 and are continuing to rise here in 2024 in the face of all of the above, it looks like a similar dynamic may be happening in Canada from the looks of it.

Just some insights I thought I’d share from our market - those waiting for a pop of a bubble might be in for a wait I think. I don’t think banks want to see their loan book evaporate either, they’ll work with homeowners if any fractures appear.

Looking for a housing affordability advocacy group,"I'm looking to get involved with a non-profit advocacy group that aims to address our affordability crisis. I've done a bit of Googling, but the orgs I've found are focused on affordable housing for low-income Canadians, so building affordable units, focus on rent controls etc. 

I'm looking for an organization that is focused on affordability for the middle class, one which focuses on solutions such as: build more housing, end blind bidding, ban foreign home ownership, ban corporate home ownership, greater incentives to first-time homebuyers, open up zoning laws, no more single-family-only homes in Toronto, tax empty homes, tax investment homes, tax house-flipping more heavily, tax short-term rentals etc.

Does an organization like this exist? I have political party and campaign experience. However, no party seems very serious about the cleavage of our middle class into a landed gentry and lifelong tenants.

For context and tl:dr, I'm a demoralized prospective home buyer with a big income, saving 3500/month, no money from mom and dad, who can't keep up with a market that just keeps running further and further away from my rate of savings. I've already settled on starting a family in a condo, but I just went and saw 2 1000sqft condos in desirable Toronto neighborhoods that went for 1.2M, which was 200-300k over asking. I just can't afford to borrow 1M, certainly not if rate hikes are in the near future, and not with an extra 800/month in condo fees. Anyway, it's an old sob story I'm sure.",TorontoRealEstate,2022-03-03 07:24:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/t5m11d/looking_for_a_housing_affordability_advocacy_group/,8
The Ontario to Alberta migration,"Ontarians have been heading out to Alberta in large numbers compared to any other province. The chart below shows the inter-migration of Ontarians to Alberta for the last few quarters. Rent in some areas of Calgary have skyrocketed by 20% since last quarter and home prices have surged over 18% since last year.  


In the first quarter of 2023, 11,564 people have moved to Alberta from Ontario and since last year over 50,000 people have left to live amongst the rockies. Almost double the amount that have gone to B.C.  


The thing with Alberta is, there isn't as much red tape to building new homes so once the interest rates drop again, developers can ramp up construction and expand the inventory much more easily than Ontario.  Right now, the housing supply is definitely lagging behind demand but this is something we've seen before:  


Whenever there's an energy boom, we see an undersupply of housing and when oil prices collapse we see an oversupply. The situation might be a little different now but not that far off and Alberta is still an economy dependent on the oil cycle. For now, high energy prices coupled with the pursuit of affordable housing will continue to fuel the Alberta economy and attract more Canadians.

Bull vs Bear cases; which talking points are BS?,"**Bull Cases:**

* Toronto Real Estate always goes up
* Indian Immigrants willing to pack 10-20 people in one home and pay rent
* Realtors giving you a gold bar to close on a pre-con
* There was no crash in 2008 in Canada, so there can't be a crash in 2024

**Bear Cases:**

* Canadians have the most household debt in the G7, most impacted by higher interest rates
* Persistent inflation, food and oil prices still going up
* Higher rates for longer
* Negative cashflow on new purchases with a mortgage
* All-cash purchases make less money than a GIC
* Toronto considered to be the biggest housing bubble in the world even by parties outside of Canada
* People can't close on pre-cons, setting them on fire, or losing money in an assignment sale
* Credit Card debt at all-time highs
* More listings YoY, less sales YoY
* Bank of Canada actively acting against higher consumption (ie. people buying RE will lead to another rate hike)
* Federal government actively acting against higher home prices (Accelerated building of more rentals)
* More and more tenant risk as rent increases month over month, they stop paying or start illegally subletting to immigrants
* LTB 2-year backlog (non-paying tenant? 10 Indians squatting in your basement? can't kick them out for 2 years)
* Political discussions are currently all around trying to improve affordability (including rent and home prices)
* Strong US economy still, they won't lower rates soon and may even hike again in the near future
* Canada cannot lower rates too far from Fed Funds rate, otherwise $CAD goes down which causes inflation
* Same price to book a hotel now as Airbnb
* High risk of job loss as we get closer to recession
* Taxes increased on home luxury home sales in Toronto
* 25% increase in property taxes in Markham
* There was no crash in 2008, so the buildup will lead to a big crash this time
* If you sell now, you can buy a bigger/better property later after the crash for the same price",TorontoRealEstate,2023-09-16 18:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/16kci3f/bull_vs_bear_cases_which_talking_points_are_bs/,0
Speculators Tax Incoming by Spring?,"[https://liberal.ca/our-plan-for-affordable-housing/](https://liberal.ca/our-plan-for-affordable-housing/)

""We will undertake a review of escalating home prices in high-priced markets – like Vancouver and Toronto – to determine whether speculation is driving up the cost of housing.""

[https://liberal.ca/our-platform/a-place-to-call-home/](https://liberal.ca/our-platform/a-place-to-call-home/)

""To limit the housing speculation that can drive up home prices, we will also put in place a consistent national tax on vacant residential properties owned by non-Canadians who don’t live in Canada.""

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/46-28-0001/2019001/article/00001-eng.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/46-28-0001/2019001/article/00001-eng.htm)

""among those who owned two properties and who lived in the provinces’ major CMAs, the most common combination of property types was two single-detached houses. This occurred regardless of where the second property was located in the province, or whether it was owned for rental or recreational purposes, or was vacant.""

""Nearly half of multiple-property owners own all of their properties within the same area in the Toronto and Vancouver CSDs""

""the data show that most owners lived in the same CSD as their other owned properties in the Toronto and Vancouver CSDs. This means that those owners may be more likely to use their other properties for rental purposes, assuming that owners are more likely to have recreational properties outside the area where they live.""

What are the odds the government implements a speculator and foreign buyers tax by spring? How should they define these, and should it include people who own investment properties?

I've looked through the data above and there are tens of thousands of people who own 4+ properties in the Toronto CMA. Given that ""they aren't building anymore land"", I don't know how socially productive it is for people to buy up 5-10 existing properties given that there's a lot of young families that want to buy them as a stable homes right now.

If the government makes holding multiple properties an unfavorable investment, this could alleviate both short term supply and demand pressure.

"Real estate investment in Toronto, modelled with actual properties and complete numbers. Do the results match what you believe about the Toronto market?","**Edit: several commenters pointed out a mistake in the calculation that improves the return substantially and changes a lot of the analysis. This post has not been updated with the correct data so many of the conclusions are inaccurate.**

There are all kinds of ""mortgage calculator"" models online, but few of them allow me to easily play with multiple scenarios and properties at the same time and see which one gets the best results. It also looks like at least some calculators do not take Toronto realities into account (for example, the fact that most properties are substantially cash negative), are not Canadian-specific (don't consider CMHC insurance), nor do they usually consider alternative investments.

So I made my own, and the results were quite interesting.

The scenario is buying a condo of various sizes (1br, 2br, 3br) either in a relatively recent building in an in-demand, popular downtown neighborhood (""hot"") or in an old building some distance from the core and in a less swanky area (""not""). The downpayment would be either 20% or minimal (around 5%, the lowest CMHC would allow). The condo would be rented out for 5 years and then sold.

All the examples here are based on actual Toronto sales of the same type and area of unit within the past several weeks. Rents are actual Toronto rents, from MLS, in the same area but not necessarily the same building. There's also a single example of a house (semi-detached) thrown in for good measure.

My baseline scenario is simple: mortgage rates around the same as they are now, alternative returns are 5% (you can buy dividend stocks returning that much and long-term S&P performance is 8% per year. It's not a stretch) and real estate appreciation is at 5% every year, or 27% in 5 years - a bit lower than Toronto's long-term average (average sold price in Toronto increased by 7% or so between 2000-2010 and 7.3% between 2010-2020; we are currently in the second year of crazy gains in a row, so slowing down is certainly a possibility).

&#x200B;

[Baseline scenario](https://preview.redd.it/sqzo4ldwuo371.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=100fb03ca8f5ba301d19159a7a90b1d64478d93c)

The first interesting bit is that all scenarios are heavily cash flow negative. It should not be a surprise to anyone -- Toronto investment properties haven't been cash positive in a very long time, but it might surprise you how much money an investor needs on an ongoing basis just to hold on to this investment -- between just under 10K a year to over 30K a year. Imagine that: you have a perfect tenant, paying every month, yet you still must fork out $2500 every single month to keep the mortgage current.

On personal finance forums, it's a common to hear this ""downside of renting"": ""You're paying the landlord's mortgage!"" In Toronto, you're not. You're *helping* the landlord to pay their mortgage, and not even helping by that much: you're covering 40-50% of their mortgage, roughly as much as the mortgage interest, and the landlord is still on the hook for the principal.

The same thing happens if you are looking to buy. A lot of discussion around buying is ""if only I had the downpayment"", from parents or pehaps from dual income or a lucky lottery ticket. Few conversations mention that a lot more disposable income is also needed to pay off the principal.

The second interesting bit is that in this scenario, it's not very attractive being a landlord. No scenarios outperform alternative investments, at best coming close to parity over five years. One bad tenant, or a special assessment, or just needing to replace a few appliances would increase the difference easily. Considering how much work it is to be a good and responsive landlord, the payoff is not great.

Note also that the best two investment scenarios are away from the downtown core, on the outskirts. If all the demand downtown is investor demand, then these investors seem dead set on choosing the worst-return areas of Toronto to purchase in...

The third interesting bit is going for the 5% downpayment is not a good choice here. The CMHC premium eats into the profits, and the savings on the downpayment are wiped out by higher mortgage payments; so much so that most of the 5% DP options end up losing money after 5 years. All the profit goes to the bank (and to the renter benefitting from lower host of housing), the investor is left nursing small losses.

Now let's look at a better scenario for Toronto RE investors and push the real estate appreciation to 7% year over year, in line with the long term results of the Toronto market (and ignoring the potential effects of the recent spikes). That's 40% in 5 years: a one bedroom downtown would cost 800-900K, anything and everything else is over a millon.

&#x200B;

[Optimistic scenario](https://preview.redd.it/z0odsshzuo371.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4c7b6f1c06b1a2036d6c64571c6db705cd2d89)

This is what everyone buying downtown condos is hoping for. The year-over-year picture is unchanged: the properties are still deeply cash negative, but it doesn't matter as long as the investor can afford to keep up with the payments. After 5 years the sale of the unit nets between $100k and $300k, and after deducting the year-over-year carrying losses the return on money invested is 6-9% yearly. This is 9k to 20k+ per year.

The leveraged nature of real estate really shines through in two ways. First, note how the most leveraged (minimal downpayment) scenarios now have the best return on investment: the investor gets up to a full percentage point more while using less of their own money.

The other leverage benefit can be seen if I adjust the alternative return on investment to 7% as well: the picture barely changes. Yes, the advantage of real estate is lower, but the best scenario only loses one seventh of its edge (35k to 30k). Unleveraged alternatives just can't compete with low margin rates and high leverage offered by mortgages. I have to push the alternative ROI to 11% to get to parity on half the scenarios, and the best scenario is competitive up to 17% alternative ROI.

Another result that runs counter to accepted wisdom happens if I start playing with the interest rates. Let's assume interest rates jump from 2% to 5% (2.3% to 5.3% for uninsured loans) but, if ""real estate is primarily bought/sold by investors"", the demand wouldn't budge (investors have deep pockets). Would the investors lose money, forcing them to exit and resulting in a market cooldown?

&#x200B;

[Optimistic scenario and high interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/t4l1wv92vo371.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a9cf346ce43394e4b483d4f139b7fd1d0f4f06)

No, the investors are fine. Not merely fine as in not losing money, but fine as in real estate is still better than alternative investments; although not by as much (approximately half the excess profits are gone, moved from landlords to banks in the form of higher interest payments). In reality, a rising interest rate would probably also crush the stock market, so the benefit of real estate would likely be even higher. Perhaps the pundits waiting for the interest rates to go up won't see as much relief as they think even if rates do finally go up.

Let's see what happens when the leverage is applied in the opposite direction. What happens if Toronto's real estate cools down after its recent meteoric rise and appreciates at inflation (3% year over year) for the next five years?

&#x200B;

[Growth at rate of inflation scenario](https://preview.redd.it/1rg4gzw4vo371.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=d03898a77734bed625acc9cf457e5db78f177c15)

What a carnage. Everybody is saying that real estate is a safe investment, but in this scenario high-leverage (lowest downpayment) units in ""hot"" neighborhoods end up losing 35-40% of the money invested over five years, or about 9% yearly. The advantages of alternative ""unsafe"" investments stretch into the six digits. The sole hypothetical non-condo owner among all the condo scenarios, who bought a 3 bedroom no parking semi-detached, walks away with a $100,000 loss because they can no longer afford to sink another $33,500 every year merely to keep the house.

If you think the government would never allow this to happen, consider who benefits and who loses. The renters are happy, or at least content: they kept on paying near-pandemic rates, skipped the risks and worries of home ownership, and could save and grow the money they would otherwise pay in principal repayments. The bankers are happy: the investor did not default and diligently paid between $35k and $108k in interest, depending on the scenario. The Ontario government is happy to receive its $20k-$88k land transfer tax (twice) and property taxes, and the federal government got its $20k-60k capital gain tax on sale of the non-primary residence. The realtors are happy: they received $40k-120k in fees, once for buying and once for selling. Other, non-investor, homeowners who live in their homes are happy: the value of their home appreciated by almost 16%, tax-free, and their retirement nest egg continues to be valuable and secure.

The non-systemically-important small scale landlord paid for a large share of others' profits, and is unlikely to bring down the financial system even if they are forced into bankruptcy by this gamble. So the government would not mind this scenario at all. And if that landlord happens to be a foreign resident, all the better...

There are two more experiments I wanted to share. The first one is based on the baseline middle-of-the-road scenario (5% appreciation). In that model, the profits weren't great at all, so I asked: where should the rents be to result in a modest edge over alternative investments over 5 years, or at least to match the alternative investment profit? Assuming a modest reward for landlording to be $2,000/year ($10,000 total), here's what I got:

&#x200B;

[Rents to achieve marginal profit in the baseline scenario](https://preview.redd.it/kz8s61e7vo371.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e105b8082e3fc16db0573b06fe1f2a067a7c4a9)

Those levels are higher than pre-pandemic, roughly matching the average housing cost appreciation (10-20%) - which makes some sense intuitively (as prices rise, landlords would need rents to come up in lockstep to maintain the return level). As Toronto reopens and becomes supply constrained again, the model tells us we should not be surprised to see these rents; but if I was a potential renter whose income wouldn't be expected to change much post-pandemic, my reaction would probably be ""Yikes!""

The final experiment starts from the pessimistic scenario (3% appreciation), where landlord losses were substantial. I asked: what should be the starting price for the investment to be truly ""safe"", meaning to break even (forget about profits, at least let's get the initial investment back)?

&#x200B;

[Prices to break even in the \\""rate of inflation appreciation\\"" scenario](https://preview.redd.it/gu6j2d7cvo371.png?width=1499&format=png&auto=webp&s=738327b1fee70ca26332762348a1f82e6b1ce7ad)

Turns out the prices would have to drop between 25% and 64%, with the average of 50%. In fact, even more than that may be necessary because if the prices drop 50% it would be unlikely rents stayed where they are, which would push my hypothetical landlord back into the red. For anyone who recently bought real estate and is wondering what could happen in a real estate slowdown, ""Yikes!"" seems appropriate as well.

Nobody really knows where the real estate market, the rents, and the interest rates are going. Each of these scenarios has a chance to become our reality. The recent [ScotiaBank predictions](https://betterdwelling.com/scotiabank-cuts-worst-case-scenario-for-canadian-real-estate-sees-higher-price-growth/) match my scenarios: their ""baseline case"" (16.3% over 5 years) is essentially my ""worst case"" (15.9%), and their ""best case"" (28.7%) is almost the same as my ""baseline case"" (27.6%).

Fine-tuning various scenarios notwithstanding, one thing seems clear: for the investors to avoid substantial losses, the appreciation cannot stop. Unlike less popular areas, where a rental unit can pay for itself and provide a modest return in a stable price environment, in Toronto a continued climb in value close to long-term historical average is already ""baked in"" to any reasonable investment thesis -- and the more rents continue to lag, the steeper the required appreciation becomes. Hopefully this model with actual properties and numbers helped you see that and make the best investment decisions for yourself.

"The next thing one should pay attention to is not the BoC's interest rate policy, but whether we will be in a recession or not.","As indicated in my five phase housing outlook, I believe we are in the back half of phase 1, where central banks will slow the pace and the size of interest rate increases (25 and 50 bps instead of 75 and 100 bps).

Seeking Guidance on Buying Property in Canada as Newcomers,"Hello Reddit Community,

As newcomers to Canada with approximately 1.5-2 years of experience here, we find ourselves facing a significant decision regarding real estate. We're reaching out to this supportive community for your valuable insights and advice, as our knowledge of the Canadian real estate market is limited.

Our budget is a maximum of $800k, and our workplaces are located on Yonge Street. We currently rent a one-bedroom apartment, and our experience has led us to prefer living in a house rather than an apartment.

Here are the two options we're considering:

**Option 1:** A condo townhome (stacked town) with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, priced at $760k, conveniently located close to our workplaces on Yonge Street.

**Option 2:** A freehold townhome or semi-detached property in Cambridge, priced at approximately $750k.  
Another question we have is, which amongst the two options would be a better financial decision?

While we are leaning towards the freehold option in Cambridge due to our desire for a house, we are concerned about the commute. We anticipate spending 1-1.5 hours commuting for two days a week ( we have a car). We've mentally prepared ourselves for this, but we would greatly appreciate hearing from the community about your experiences with long commutes to work. Is it worth it?

As newcomers to Canada, we are navigating this important decision with limited experience, and your advice and personal experiences would be incredibly helpful in making an informed choice. Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights! 🏡🇨🇦",TorontoRealEstate,2023-09-07 21:58:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/16cq9u4/seeking_guidance_on_buying_property_in_canada_as/,0
Toronto Real Estate Market Bear Thesis,"I have been considering whether to enter the market for the past few weeks, and I have decided to remain on the sidelines for now. I have outlined the reasons below.

But first, I think it's important to understand why ""renting is throwing money away"" simply isn't true. I found a short video which does a great job of explaining why, which I strongly recommend watching:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwl3-jBNEd4

The bottom line is there are sunk costs associated with both renting and buying, and real estate is not the only available investment. The decision whether to rent or buy depends on the specific circumstances, i.e. what are the alternative investments, and how do they compare.

Renting in Toronto is currently cheaper than buying according to various metrics (including the ones mentioned in the video). Buying only makes sense if you expect the property to continue appreciating at 6% per year. While this has been true over the past 10 years, there are good reasons to believe it is no longer going to be true in the near future.

Many highly reputable sources (who have access to much better information than home buyers and retail investors) are calling Toronto one of the most overvalued real estate markets in the world, and one that is overdue for a correction. This includes:

- The International Monetary Fund: ""Assessing House Prices in Canada"" (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/11/15/Assessing-House-Prices-in-Canada-48777):

> ...in Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver house prices have increased beyond the values implied by the fundamentals.

- The International Monetary Fund: ""Downside Risks to House Prices"" (https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF082/25728-9781498302104/25728-9781498302104/ch02.xml):

> In 2018, US house prices seemed less overvalued, judging from the price-to-income ratio, which would make a potential bust of the housing market much more contained than in 2008. In contrast, the housing market in Canada headed in the opposite direction, especially in such cities as Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver, where valuations look overstretched, much as in 2008.

- UBS Group (https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/static/noindex/wealth-management/ubs-global-real-estate-bubble-index-en-1509323.pdf):

> Toronto ranks third in the bubble risk assessment.
... 
Underpinned by improving financing conditions, prices jumped by almost 6% over the last four quarters as demand for single-family houses in the suburbs grew considerably. Yet affordability is already stretched. New supply should be considerable in the coming quarters. Moreover, the expected appreciation of the Canadian dollar will curb the appeal of Toronto’s property to foreign buyers when travel restrictions are lifted.

- RBC Royal Bank ""Focus on Canadian Housing"" (https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/steaming-hot-housing-market-conditions-persist-despite-cold-february-weather/):

> While it’s natural tight demand-supply conditions heat up property values, signs of overheating have emerged.

- RBC Royal Bank: ""First Quarter 2021 Report"" (https://www.rbc.com/investor-relations/_assets-custom/pdf/2021q1_report.pdf):

> The range of annual housing price growth (contraction) in our alternative downside and upside scenarios is (29.6)% to 8.0% over the next 12 months and 4.5% to 11.1% for the following 2 to 5 years. As at October 31, 2020, our base forecast included housing price growth of 0.6% for the next 12 months and 4.5% for the following 2 to 5 years.

- The Bank of Canada ""Monetary Policy Report"" (https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/mpr-2021-01-20.pdf):

> Housing market activity is expected to soften gradually from current elevated levels.
...
As activity eases, price growth should soften.

- Robert Shiller, the Nobel prize winning economist who predicted both the 2000 and 2008 financial crashes, in an interview with the Financial Post (https://financialpost.com/investing/robert-shiller-on-canadian-housing-bubble-market-distractions-like-trump-and-new-bmo-etf):

> Existing real estate in established cities like Toronto and Vancouver looks bubbly to me, and I would be concerned. I wouldn’t advise someone to buy two or three houses in Toronto. I don’t know what exactly is driving it, and I know it’s not just Canada — it’s also New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong and Shanghai. History doesn’t show this as a good investing strategy, as even great cities don’t appreciate very much over time. It’s very slow compared to other investments and in the long run, it hasn’t worked out. If you look at major U.S. cities over 100 years, they do not appreciated that much. That’s because cities are spreading out, and office centres move further away. A recent study showed home prices are higher in boxed in areas. That’s logical, but Toronto isn’t boxed in.

No one knows when a correction will happen, but I think there is a good chance that it will happen. In general, smart investors buy assets at prices that are below the intrinsic value. Purchasing Toronto real estate right now is buying above the intrinsic value. Buying high is generally not a good way to make money.

Yes, it might continue to go up. So might Bitcoin, penny stocks, and other speculative financial investments. I'm not comfortable investing the majority of my net worth in speculation.

If I really want to invest in real estate, doing it somewhere with better Price-to-Rent and/or Price-to-Income ratios would be a much smarter investment. Here's a list of cities around the world along with their price indexes: https://www.numbeo.com/property-investment/rankings.jsp.

(I think Austin, Texas looks interesting, especially since there is currently an exodus of tech workers from San Francisco to Austin; see https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/12/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-predicts-austin-become-united-states-boomtown/6737704002/).

The only way that it might make sense to buy real estate in Toronto is if the property is one which I want to live in for a very long time, e.g. decades.

If you would like to read more about the Toronto real estate market, this is the most comprehensive article I've found on the subject: https://www.mortgagesandbox.com/toronto-real-estate-forecast

I would also like to stress that my decision not to buy this particular property at this moment in time does in no way invalidate your real estate decisions. Everyone's circumstances are different, and what made sense for you in the past does not necessarily make sense for me in the present.

"Canada needs to boost home building by 50 per cent to keep up with immigration, report says","[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canada-build-housing-immigratio](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canada-build-housing-immigration/)[n/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canada-build-housing-immigration/)

Canada needs to ramp up home building by 50 per cent just to keep pace with [immigration](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/immigration/), according to a new report.

The country is on track to break ground on about 210,000 housing units this year, according to Desjardins Securities. But the Desjardins report says about 100,000 additional housing starts are needed this year and next, as Canada gets ready to admit a record number of immigrants.

Many economists and real estate industry experts believe there is a severe shortage of [housing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/housing/) in the country – and it will only get worse. Canada has [increased immigration levels](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-immigration-backlog-visitor-visas-canada/) to make up for the shortfall during the first year of the pandemic and to help fill jobs in construction, health care and other areas.

With the federal government planning to admit 1.45 million new permanent residents over the next three years, the report says, housing starts must become a priority, in part because of the time it takes to complete a housing unit.

“We have to dig out of a hole and move higher ultimately,” said Randall Bartlett, Desjardins’ senior director of Canadian economics.

A large share of [new immigrants](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-immigration-to-canada-hits-record-in-2022/) end up in Ontario and B.C., two provinces where home prices have historically risen faster than in the rest of the country.

Although the typical [home price across Canada dropped](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-toronto-house-resales-prices-decline/) 13 per cent from the peak last February by December, the average price in the most popular destinations – [Toronto](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-toronto-home-prices-expected-to-rise-in-second-half-of-2023-regional/) and Vancouver – still tops $1-million.

“If these newcomers to Canada continue the recent trend of moving to Ontario and British Columbia, affordability there and nationally will erode further,” says the report, authored by Mr. Bartlett and Marc Desormeaux, the bank’s principal economist.

At the same time, [rental rates have been quickly increasing](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canada-apartment-vacancy-rate/) as many would-be homebuyers have had to continue renting owing to higher mortgage rates.

Desjardins’s call for more home construction echoes statements from the national housing agency, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., which has repeatedly said the country needs to increase its supply of homes.

There were 261,849 housing starts last year, according to government data. That is expected to decrease this year because developers postponed product launches when the costs of borrowing and construction soared.",TorontoRealEstate,2023-02-14 20:05:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/112db5m/canada_needs_to_boost_home_building_by_50_per/,21
Any good agents that do more than a bare minimum? Msg me for business,"I've dealt with about 5 different agents over the last 2 years for my various properties... buying and renting my own and to this day, I can't find agents that are willing to spend money on advertising. Most do the absolute bare minimum. It just seems like because property prices are so high and all these agents really need to do is sell 1-2 houses to make the equivalent of what an average Canadian makes that rental type work is not even worth considering, even if it means, I buy from them every few years.

I've had agents lie about sending offers or not even send them!! and then having properties sold for the amount I said I'd pay...

Another agent who after asking 5 times doesn't lower the asking price for a property I need to sell, perhaps they want a higher commission or are ""busy"" or just forgot... Sigh\*

Then I've had agents cancel the appointments because of their own emergency and say it was the other agent that cancelled

Now I've got an agent who hasn't even spent $100 posting professional photos for a condo or a video that has been on the market for 4 months in Core DT in a nice high-end building... Our rent is already pretty low compared to others and it's just been sitting vacant with me needing to post on Kijiji and sending him potential tenants along with talking to tenants to filter them...

I also haven't met a single agent that has \_any\_ strategic advantage. I mean they all post to the  Kijiji and all post on MLS.. most agents from what I have seen never secured any deals or closed anything quicker through their own network, or with the use of technology, or just provide better customer service even...

Real estate law / real estate agents need a redo in Canada. Definitely also tired of all the opaque ""bidding wars"",  and houses listed for $999,888 being sold for $1,888,888 in Markham. It really doesn't matter what price is listed, you will be told there is another bidder, so give your final offer, no conditions...or gtfo.

Just the tip of the iceberg ... I've picked from brokerages downtown to family friends to part-time agents... it's generally always the same. I am not asking to lower commission or fees or anything, just do the work you are being paid to do!

Speculation on Baby Boomer/Demographics and Housing Supply,"TL;DR: Huge demographic cohort which is currently occupying a lot of choice housing will over the next 20+ years stop occupying a lot of housing, without a younger population to absorb it like in the past.

---------------------

We talk a lot of about immigration numbers, but of course there's the aging demographics and below replacement fertility rate that has lead the Feds to implement these policies. Everything here is very speculative and pretty crude in concept. All using statcan's numbers.

I've charted this to highlight how changes in demographics might affect demand for housing:

[See here](https://imgur.com/Buo7uqJ)

**Simplified:**

Green: crude estimate of young people looking to buy a first house ('First Time Home Buyer' FTHB) based just on age

Red: crude estimate of old people likely to sell their last house ('Last Time Home Seller' LTHS) based just on age

Yellow (right axis): difference between those buyers and sellers numbers

Grey (right axis): Number of dwelling 'multiples' (condos/apts) built * 1.5 + number of houses
(detached/semis/row) completed each year * 3, divided by 2.25; a very crude way to normalize the change in dwelling construction types/sizes/bedrooms. But this is more of a reminder to consider that new builds satisfy the gap's demand in the long term; I think there's a lot of caveats about construction completions and housing stock to use these numbers at face value.


**So:**

Unsurprisingly, the aging of the boomer population shows up quite clearly. The peak number of births in the late 50s/early 60s corresponds to the FTHB population peak in the late 80s, which you should remember corresponded to a large house price run-up. Also interesting to see how high construction numbers were then and consider that would have muted prices for the early demographic rise. 

The size of the millennial/baby-boom-echo population is almost fully muted, not that it was too large to begin with, probably flattened out by the immigration population coming in at these ages in surrounding years.

Since the boomers have only started to age out of peak housing population in high numbers (births peaked around the end of the boomer range, mode at 1958 which is only 64yo now), you can see we're just passing a sustained high level of new housing need caused by the new youth population growth. But over the period of the next 13 to 20 years, we're going to see this Net FTHB - LTHS drop greatly and go far below what we've seen in the last decades. I also imagine that the size/location of these units that come available will be superior to what's been available recently, making this even more pronounced.

**Data:**

This was made using Statcan's historic age pyramid stitched together with their projected High Growth population model. I then summed the age groups into 25-40 and 70-85, and divided those sums by 15 to get a yearly representative number. Statcan's high growth projection model seems most representative of current immigration targets at 1.08% growth and non-permanent residences increasing to 2 million. I don't know how statcan estimates demographics of immigrants. If they've placed a considerable number of newcomers in to the 40+ buckets, the analysis will have missed them.

Of course, people before 25 demand housing accommodation as do people over 85 (life expectancy at 85 is still another 7 years), but the <25 are more likely to rent, live at home, and therefore possess smaller or fractional units, and the old people are more likely to have moved to smaller units that require less upkeep. Changing it to 75 to 90 basically pushes the Net FTHB-LTHS trough out 5 years.

I know people say the dying or downsizing boomers will just give their houses to their children, but even so the knock-on effect is their children vacating their current places, so there's still an impact.",TorontoRealEstate,2022-05-08 18:47:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/ul72c9/speculation_on_baby_boomerdemographics_and/,9
GTA Housing stress question,"So we have three kids (teens), and due to not having the capital to save for a downpayment until the past couple of years, we have been long time renters. We have had our rental homes sold and had to move multiple times. My partner and I are both contract/self-employed. We have been looking for a home (4BR/3+1 semi) in GTA since July. Had we known the market was going to skyrocket, we would probably have bought something in EY that was less than ideal, but we waited hoping for increased inventory in the fall and managed to save enough to bump our budget above 1M -- however, the inventory did not increase, and as soon as we were able to start looking over 1M it literally seemed like prices jumped by 200K, so all the semis in our size range are now 1.4. After paying the larger downpayment/closing costs, we also won't have any extra cash to renovate, so fixer-uppers are out for us. I'm feeling nauseous about paying $300K more for a house, in probably a crappier area (expanded search from EY to Rockcliffe-Smythe, etc.) than we were seeing six months ago. We can afford a house, and would be ok with rate increases up to 5%-ish. However, if rates went up to 7%+ e.g., when we went to renew, with the massive mortgage, we would be really struggling (e.g., 9K/month just for mortgage, according to ratehub). Now wondering if we should just accept being lifelong renters, with the lack of housing security that comes with?

Housing Affordability will shape the 2019 Federal Election," A recent Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives study found that a third of all Canadian households rent their homes — and in only three per cent of Canadian neighbourhoods can ""a full-time minimum wage worker … afford to rent an average two-bedroom apartment."" Yet we have 421,000 new jobs in the last year, employment is up 2.3 per cent, unemployment and poverty rates are at historical lows. If the economy is doing so well, why do so many Canadians feel like they can’t get in ahead?

Why are realtors so deceptive?,"I apologize but I need to get this off my chest.

Why are realtors so dumb/deceptive bro? Like whyyy?

I especially dislike this guy lol - trying to make it seem like Option 2 is a “bad choice” and he’s got the whole “I’m not like other realtors 🤪” schtick. 

Like there’s no value in having a home you control? Forced savings for the millions of Canadians that don’t have the discipline? The fact that interest consistently decreases as you pay it down vs rent always goes up (bro conveniently left that out)?

If you’re a realtor your only advice should be (1) do you want to own a home and (2) can you afford it comfortably.

Need a rant flair for this sub.

"Higher rents, housing costs to hinder future success of large Canadian cities: Economists - BNN Bloomberg",,TorontoRealEstate,2023-07-18 02:21:46,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/higher-rents-housing-costs-to-hinder-future-success-of-large-canadian-cities-economists-1.1945827,23
Why do Canadians have the stereotype that investors prefer to leave real estate empty and just profit off the capital gains?,"There seems to be constant posts in Canadian reddits about foreign investors who are buying all our housing and leaving it empty. But that doesn't make logical sense for an investor to do. You'd be losing 2-3% a month. Sure renting it out is work but an ""investor"" naturally pursues the path of greatest return. Is this just a stereotype spread by non-investors who don't understand finance?

There is an argument for leaving properties empty in the short-term, especially in provinces that make evictions legally difficult and/or ban fixed term rental agreements. But I can hardly see that as a large issue as it's temporary and investors would be losing out quite a bit on opportunity costs annually.

Also speaking of stereotypes, what's with the belief that foreigners are buying all our housing? Is it just racists who say foreigners when they mean non-whites? Because statistically even in BC pre-foreign buyer tax foreign buyers were only buying 1-2% of properties which is below the US, Aus, and British avgs which are 5%+. And obviously foreigners weren't using companies or other workarounds back before there was an incentive to do so.

Somethings I feel like people are just looking for an excuse to justify why housing is expensive despite the government they elected being in power. You can't blame yourself or those you voted for so the ones ""different"" get blamed aka the rich, foreigners, non-whites, etc. I also never understood this hate against investors, logically if there were no housing investors we'd have no housing for renters and they'd all be homeless right? Most nations offer large incentives for housing investors because that money boosts the economy and taxbase while working to bring rents down. Most provinces/the fed offers large incentives for First Nations tribes to build rental housing and the same people criticizing private investors seem to support it if their First Nation being subsidized by their own taxes and being exempt from the usual taxes private investors would pay? How is that logical?",TorontoRealEstate,2025-05-10 19:49:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/1kjhdu3/why_do_canadians_have_the_stereotype_that/,31
Does anyone have any idea why our federal liberal government would vote against revising the immigration targets amid the housing crisis and healthcare system crisis. It still passed thankfully but why are they dying on this hill? Why isn’t the media covering this as well?,"I don’t know how this is not on every news channel. In the face of what can only be described as the worst housing crisis in the history of Canada, shelters over-run, homeless encampments popping up everywhere, 25 international students living in basements, Canadians renting bathrooms, our healthcare system basically breaking down before our eyes because of the massive demand and staff not being able to meet it. I don’t know how many of you use Toronto public transportation but that’s in disarray as well. A Canadian hero who I didn’t know too well until today Mr. Blanchet of Quebec brought forward this motion for the Feds to consult with the provinces about being able to integrate this population boom and in 100 days come up with a plan to revise immigration numbers.

In a big fuck you to Canada the entire liberal party voted no. Read the names at the bottom of that page. Jagmeet Sign voted yes (he finally grew one), Pollievre voted yes and I guess the bloc did too. Ahmed Hussein, Freeland, Tredeau, Sean Fraser Marc Miller and many others voted no. Our media should be covering this around the clock, our government is actively undermining Canadians and the Canadian working class, while getting on microphones at press conferences and gaslighting us into thinking they’re attempting to address affordability. 

Furthermore why the hell are they trying to tax us on pollution while bringing in another 2M people a year who will increase our carbon footprint and require the development of farmland and green spaces for living quarters. Our federal government should be jailed. This is treason.

Where is the CRA and federal government in all of this. Why are they not seizing homes in clear cases of money laundering in Canada?,"What the hell is going on with the CRA. We have foreigners using our homes as high interest savings accounts and the overpriced rent they charge from Canadians acts as the interest while they buy up many homes and enjoy the appreciation. Canadians go and try and buy two homes in China….you can’t. Try to be a landlord in China….you can’t.

https://www.yklaw.us/blog/2020/09/buying-property-in-china-as-a-foreigner/

A bombshell report has come out about HSBC’s money laundering activities for Chinese clients getting high amounts of mortgages with bullshit incomes. I believe it. The reason being is because these stories align. Chinese individuals making huge cash purchases that have no income in Canada and are getting social services from Canada like welfare.

Here are articles from Vancouver where one of the richest communities by postal code in Vancouver mainly made up of Chinese diaspora had one of the highest uses of welfare in Vancouver. This all came out when two wealthy Chinese families got into a dispute so the idiots allowed themselves to be scrutinized. If they didn’t I don’t think anyone would’ve ever looked. 

Owned million dollar homes in Vancouver and claimed $97.11 as their income.

https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/thousands-of-metro-vancouver-mansion-owners-avoiding-taxes

Now compare that and contrast that with the claims from the whistleblower.

“The most shocking case reviewed by The Bureau, shows that one woman that owns at least four Toronto properties opened her HSBC Aurora bank account in 2012, claiming to be a “Homemaker with no annual income.” 

https://www.thebureau.news/p/fake-chinese-income-mortgages-fuel

This lady bought 4 Toronto properties over 2 million dollars in real estate in total and she has no income. 

Where’s the CRA in this to protect Canadians and the sanctity of our financial markets and real estate sector. How the fuck does the CRA go after a Canadian for misfiling taxes on 10k but ignores a Chinese person with no income owning 20M in properties as an example claiming welfare checks. 

HSBC should be completely blacklisted from the entire mortgage industry in Canada if not the entire banking sector in Canada if this is true. This is the same organization that was bankrolling the Sinaloa cartel. Your kids died from fentanyl or cocaine or drugs from Mexico and the Sinaloa cartel HSBC was their banker. They also are the bank of choice for scammers and terrorists. Basically this bank is just fucking corrupt and dirty worldwide. They’re a leading bank for mortgages in Canada worldwide.

It’s simple. You want to address money laundering in Canada. It needs to start with the government. Not reporting income worldwide for taxation great assets seized and sold you go to jail and if you have citizenship yours along with whoever you came with and financially support stripped and deported with a never return on your file. Every bank, real estate agent, and lawyer should have to report to FINTRAC any suspicious activity (having no income but buying a 5M dollar home is an example). If not they should be charged as accomplices. Every large cash transaction should be audited going back from the Harper years. If they can’t disclose how they got the money, home and assets should be seized, you go to jail for money laundering and citizenship removed with a never to return if you’re not from here.

Any casino that does not report suspicious activity to the Canadian government and authorities should be hit with terrorism and money laundering charges.  The owners should be jailed have their licenses removed and their assets seized too. You need to show teeth to repel people from engaging in this. People are walking into casinos and cleaning millions in human trafficking money and drug money then buying houses.

This is only about how the Chinese community is doing it. The same thing is happening with the Indian community. 

This is Gurcharan Rehal a Punjabi man who would make wallstreet bets proud. He was somehow allowed to purchase a 2M dollar home in Brampton with $90k in upgrades. His income in Canada you wouldn’t believe it, an Uber driver who plans to live hand to mouth and had previous business income from India (Bullshit). If he can’t explain to the CRA how he got that income and should be taxed on it his asset should be seized he should be arrested and deported along with his family. If they have PR or citizenship that should also be removed.

https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6685427

Here we have real estate agents who also serve as part time magicians when it comes to falsifying  incomes for mortgages on camera.

And I quote 

“Income is not an issue,"" said one real estate agent while showing documents he was working on for other clients. ""This is what we turn into their income. Even if you are making zero dollars, even if you are a housewife, we can make the income. The only thing we cannot make is credit.""

""You know, by books, you will not qualify,"" said another agent, who went on to describe how his contacts could help. ""They will do some documentation showing that you guys are making more and they will get you what you want. But they cannot openly say it out in public because that's not true.""

https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6614132

If the CRA and the federal government doesn’t want to do it’s job to protect Canadians step the fuck to the side and let Canadians do it. Make a law giving 60% of income seized or fines retrieved from selling assets given to whistleblowers tax free who report money launderers with evidence. They’d be doing the majority of the work. That will become a massive industry if they let that law pass. 

Again I ask where is the CRA and federal government is on this. It’s happening in broad daylight. Don’t forget to not misreport that 5k on your taxes middle class the CRA might charge you a massive penalty if you screw that up meanwhile people are buying million dollar homes on welfare with no income.

"Several Nazi Platform points that get repeated in today's conversation regarding real estate, corporations, etc.","In his 1920 speech Hitler laid out the Nazi's 25 point platform, which generally focused on the 3 pillars of antisemitism, nationalism, and socialism. It's kind of funny to see several of their platform points pursued today. Obviously even the evilest governments have some points that many Canadians would support. Universal welfare, nationalization of corporate trusts, partial government ownership of large corporations, breakup of monopolies/oligopolies, expropriation of land for development/housing without compensation, eliminating leasehold property, banning investment in land, universal education, and public corporations.

""7. We demand that the State shall make it its primary duty to provide a livelihood for its citizens. If it should prove impossible to feed the entire population, foreign nationals (non-citizens) must be deported from the Reich.""

13. We demand the nationalization of all businesses which have been formed into corporations (trusts).

14. We demand profit-sharing in large industrial enterprises.

16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a healthy middle class, the immediate communalizing of big department stores, and their lease at a cheap rate to small traders, and that the utmost consideration shall be shown to all small traders in the placing of State and municipal orders.

17. We demand a land reform suitable to our national requirements, the passing of a law for the expropriation of land for communal purposes without compensation; the abolition of ground rent, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.

19. We demand that Roman Law, which serves a materialistic world order, be replaced by a German common law.

20. The State must consider a thorough reconstruction of our national system of education (with the aim of opening up to every able and hard-working German the possibility of higher education and of thus obtaining advancement). The curricula of all educational establishments must be brought into line with the requirements of practical life. The aim of the school must be to give the pupil, beginning with the first sign of intelligence, a grasp of the notion of the State (through the study of civic affairs). We demand the education of gifted children of poor parents, whatever their class or occupation, at the expense of the State.

25. To put the whole of this program into effect, we demand the creation of a strong central state power for the Reich; the unconditional authority of the political central Parliament over the entire Reich and its organizations; and the formation of Corporations based on estate and occupation for the purpose of carrying out the general legislation passed by the Reich in the various German states.""

Demand on Canadian Housing,"Friends. 

A lot of talk about demand on this sub. A lot of accusations about inflated numbers. Every time I post the actual numbers I get called mean names. 

Lets take a look. 

Bloomberg via CIBC reports;

- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government plans to welcome 465,000 new permanent residents this year, and increase the annual target to half a million by 2025. But those often-cited numbers understate the pressure on the country’s limited supply of housing —because they don’t include a wave of foreign students, temporary workers and others with non-permanent visas. 
The country actually had close to 1 million international arrivals last year, according to an analysis by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce that’s based on other data, including visas. It will probably accept a similar number this year, said Benjamin Tal, the bank’s deputy chief economist.

Tax on $1M+ homes will not be making Canadian housing more affordable.,"Hi fellow BC residence. I'm not sure how many people have heard of the proposed tax on capital gains for homes worth over $1M but this is a really bad idea for the following reasons:

1. Sellers will pass on any new tax to buyers and renters increasing the housing cost even more.
2. This will stop people from wanting to sell decreasing the supply.
3. Many young people who own a condo or even rent will think this won't affect them. Well no. Many of you may not want to think about this but you do have parents who own detached houses obviously worth over $1M which over the next decade(s) will need to be sold and split among the adult kids.

Not to mention these homes were already purchased with after tax dollars. The only way is to increase the supply of housing.

What's happening with the Vancouver craigslist rental market? An analysis.,"I posted this as a comment on a separate thread, but there was a decent amount of positive feedback so I thought I'd turn it into its own post because... Karma? But also, I think it's an important topic and deserves some discussion. Here's the original comment:

\-----

For the last few weeks, I've been checking Craigslist every day to see what the housing rental market is doing in Vancouver. Here are my observations so far:

* Average prices of listings seem to have already fallen by about $200-300 per unit in most neighbourhoods. I've seen some places literally listed again each week at $100 less than they were the week before (and some of them are still dropping).
* A TON of very obviously AirBnB places (furnished, professional photos) are on the market, and they're getting more and more desperate. Most started as ""short term only, furnished"" and then became ""Short term preferred, furnished"" and are now ""Short or long term, furnished of unfurnished."" They're also dropping prices - sometimes aggressively.
* To keep up, some larger and more commercial property owners - and even some smaller ones - are starting to offer discounts. ""First month free"" or ""First six months at half price"" or ""MOVE IN SPECIAL! Gift card + gym membership"" etc. are starting to pop up more and more.
* For the first time since I can remember, I'm regularly seeing places that feel more affordable coming back on the market. Don't get me wrong - shit still ain't cheap. But there are multiple new listings every day for decent 1br places in the $1,200 range (would be very affordable for a couple earning minimum wage), and there are starting to be decent 2br places for \~$1,400 popping up regularly.

And, I suspect things are just beginning:

>The Canadian government reports that more than 150,000 international students were enrolled in public and private postsecondary institutions, elementary and secondary schools and private language training schools in B.C. in 2017.... International students in all institution types are concentrated in Lower Mainland/Southwest institutions (68%) ([HESLOP, 2018](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/post-secondary-education/data-research/stp/stp-international-research-results.pdf)).

That's \~102,000 int'l students in metro Vancouver. Let's say even HALF of those student leave (or have already left and don't come back) - that's about 50,000 fewer people needing homes come September.

Also...

>Short-term rental platform Airbnb says hosts in the city of Vancouver earned $62 million this summer. The company said about 224,000 guests stayed in Airbnb listings in Vancouver between May 24 and Sept. 2 \[of 2019\], with the typical booking being worth $169... According to the city, as of the end of August there were 5,866 active listings in Vancouver. ([Global News, 2019](https://globalnews.ca/news/5894358/vancouver-airbnb-hosts-raked-in-62m-this-summer-company-says/))

That's 224,000 less short term listings, from a total of \~6,000 total units that will be empty.

On top of that, I couldn't find any stats but anecdotally we know that every summer hundreds if not thousands of young professionals on working holiday visas some from the UK, Ireland, Australia, etc. to work in bars, restaurants, and the film industry.

Then, factor in that unemployment in Metro Vancouver was [5.4% in March,](https://www.workbc.ca/Labour-Market-Information/Regional-Profiles/Mainland-Southwest) expected to grow to \~10% through April. That means 262,000 people out of work, making no money or $2,000 per month from the CERB. Thousands of those people are likely to start breaking their leases to reduce expenses by living with their partners, parents, or room mates. And thousands of these inter-provincial workers and students are abandoning the city to go back to their home cities - and many may never come back.

\----

The reason things are slow to drop is that as other users have mentioned, rental prices are ""sticky"" and not just influenced by immediate supply and demand forces. Just to give two examples of why there would be a lag:

1. A couple bought a house with a ""mortgage helper"" suite. Their mortgage was $5,000 per month, and they can't really afford that on their income, but the tiny 1br airbnb basement suite was bringing in \~$2000 per month in extra income (rented out at $180 per night for an average of 12 nights per month). Now, that income is gone. They defer payments for 2 months to give them some time to find someone. Then, they list it on Craigslist for $2,000 for April 1 to try and replace what they were making, but there are no takers. So, they reduce the price to $1,900 for May 1. As of right now, they still have no takers, so they re-list for May 15th for $1,800. But, they literally can't afford to go lower than this; if they can't make at least $1,800 per month off the unit, they won't be able to afford to make their mortgage payments on their income. Some people email them asking about the unit to see if they'll take $1,500, but they hold firm (for now) at $1,800 because they know they can't afford to take less.
2. A landlord with three buildings (8 total units) has had tenants move out (they moved back to their hometown because they lost their jobs at a restaurant). The tenants were paying $2,500 for a 2br. The landlord lists the place at $2,500 for April 1. No takers, so he re-lists at $2,300 for May 1. Still no one. He does the math; $400 per month is worth $9,600 in rent over two years, and his tenants usually stay for about two years. $9,600 is almost 4 months' rent, so he figures it's worth it to wait up to 4 months at the current price rather than drop it another $200/month just to try to find someone so he holds tight for now. He figures he can always from in June if it's still empty.

In both of these cases, something will give eventually if things don't get better. As more and more tenants miss their rental payment and landlords start to read the writing on the wall, I expect we'll see an even more rapid decrease in rental prices. Some landlords won't be able to get tenants at break-even costs, and will be forced to sell or foreclose (and of course, this will start to have impacts on real estate values). Starting in late summer, the impact of the missing students and int'l workers will really start to kick in. And of course, even as the economy picks back up some people will run out of CERB after 4 months but their jobs won't yet be back online (or they may never come back because the business they worked for went under).

I know this was a LOOOOOOONG post, but I feel like some of these stats and stories are worth keeping in mind as we imagine what's to come. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and we haven't really even BEGUN to feel the economic impacts of this pandemic yet. If I had to put money on it, I'd guess that the current softening is going to get worse and worse, and by the end of the summer or definitely by September, you'll start to see a real, bonafide collapse in YVR real-estate.

***tl;dr:*** *Prices have already softened, and there are WAY more rentals out there than usual. Plus, there are about to be 50,000+ fewer international students in Vancouver, 200,000+ tourists who won't visit this summer, thousands of summer holiday visa workers who'll stay away, and a quarter-million locals out of work.

The cost of buying a home in Metro Vancouver is a fucking scandal. The situation now is that upcoming generations now depend on inherited wealth to own a home. Period. The home owning class has become entrenched and is getting richer, while everyone else is being locked out. 

A good chunk of people who do own their homes would be devastated by a job loss, a rise in interest rates, or a downturn in the housing market. This last point is clearly driving policy at the civic, provincial, and federal levels. In other words, lawmakers talk about affordability while doing whatever they can to make sure the market keeps going up. They’ve held on to the rising balloon for so long that letting go will mean death as opposed to a broken ankle.

The downstream effects of the current situation are simultaneously massive and practically ignored. Families and social circles are broken up because people have to move away to where they can afford. People are stuck in miserable or even dangerous housing situations because they cannot afford to finance two households when they can barely afford one. People are spending so much money on housing that they can’t afford other things, which sucks for them but also for local businesses who depend on disposable income. People who are lucky enough to have money to invest would be foolish to start a business, when investing in real estate is so much more likely to pay off. Owners of commercial spaces would rather storefronts remain empty than lower rents and tip the world off to the declining value of their property. It goes on and on and on.

Trudeau and Horgan were both elected after talking about housing affordability, but the federal Libs and the BC NDP have presided over even more massive increases in prices. The cost of the average Canadian home has DOUBLED since the Libs formed government. 

There needs to be a genuine political movement. Ban foreign ownership and develop real mechanisms for effectively enforcing this. Ban the purchase of homes by investment firms. Reduce the bonkers immigration targets that the Feds have come up with by at least half. These would be a start.",Vancouver,2023-04-11 19:08:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/12is6oo/where_is_the_outrage_over_housing_prices/,18
Honest question to Vancouverites: Can you let us know why you do OR don't see a problem with the current financial situation in Vancouver?,"It's a well-known fact to many Vancouverites and unfortunately those who were born with wealth do not understand the struggles many of us face on a daily basis. Minimum wage laws do not match the cost of life in this city and nothing is being done by our elected officials to change that. 

While many Canadians and foreigners profited from the artificial housing market boom in Vancouver, they've opposed any measures to make it harder for the rich to manipulate the housing market. Those people are our parents, friends, neighbors from all walks of life. They invested early with cheap, very affordable prices with low interest rates and made hundreds of thousands of dollars during the past decade. They don't see a reason to stop this train. These people are the reason why we, under 40 year olds, will pay for the ignorance of the older generations.

Some will disagree with what I'm saying, and I respect that, but if you do, ask yourself: In what way has the current financial market benefited you? Did it make your family rich and you're just defending their ""legitimate earnings""? Did you buy a home years ago and now you're rich and ""fuck you for being jealous""? Are you the descendant of a rich businessman who flipped houses and are maintaining his legacy? Did you graduate university, got a new job and have total disregard to everybody else because ""You're fucking lazy if you can't get a job, I can!""? Or maybe a legitimate reason that earns respect from most of us...

I'd like to have this discussion with all of you. I used a throwaway to not gain any karma from this. ",Vancouver,2013-10-22 19:50:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1ozsn3/honest_question_to_vancouverites_can_you_let_us/,24
Are foreign buyers driving up housing prices?,,Vancouver,2016-05-16 04:07:06,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlmE6-0DFQk,49
"Hate to stir shit up, Vancouver being perfect and all that, but I'm going to post a letter I sent to Ministry of Health, in hopes of starting a debate on BC's expensive health premiums","To whom it may concern, 

I am writing to express my disappointment with British Columbia's MSP system. I recently moved from Ontario in June 2013, after living for more than 10 years in Toronto, Ontario. It was to my surprise when I moved here that I was informed about BC's MSP system, as I never heard or was aware of the situation before I moved to BC. 

First, the idea that I have to pay a monthly fee for health service in Canada is absolutely strange to me, having been used to the system in Ontario, where I would simply pay a fee on my provincial taxes at the end of the year. It seems like BC is the last province in Canada to still use such a complex system for billing and collecting health premiums. Now having experienced both systems, I can say without a doubt that Ontario's setup is much more desirable as a citizen and resident of the province, with the ease and fairness with which the health premium is administered.

Second, as a self employed person with a fluctuating income, I find the MSP system to be very rigid and unforgiving, resulting in my being charged a premium that does not adequately reflect my income. The fact that the system uses my last year's income to determine my premium today, regardless of how much income I have this month and for this year, puts me in a situation where I can't afford to pay my bills some months. It puts an added needless stress onto my mind, which I already have lots of stress trying to find clients and run my business so I can pay for rent and food this month.

Third, the MSP phone system has me waiting an unbelievable 15-20 minutes each time I call, causing frustration as I have to put off work to call during the open hours to speak to a representative about my account. Compounded by the issue that the website claims that ""temporary payment assistance"" is not retroactive, so I am forced to call immediately the day-of the problem, I have to put my work on hold so I can deal with this issue every month I have a delinquency. And then only to find out that I have to call another department, and wait another 15-20 minutes in the queue. I find the whole experience to be frustrating and time consuming.

Fourth, I find the BC premiums to be absolutely offensive in how expensive they are compared to the rest of Canada. There needs to be an investigation into the rates being charged for basic health premiums in BC compared to the other provinces, and the premium needs to be drastically lowered. As a young low-income individual with a common law spouse, the rates are simply not affordable for us. I feel like the system was setup to exert an overt pressure on young low-income individuals, which is especially difficult in Vancouver with the record-high prices of rent, food, and transportation (either gas/insurance or transit fees). 

Fifth, last year after taxes I earned $31,000, which puts me at the maximum bracket for the MSP premium. Additionally, I have a common law spouse who is currently unemployed, under-educated/under-skilled, and having difficulty finding any work at all (even minimum wage work). So not only am I responsible for housing and feeding THE TWO OF US, but now I also have to pay her MSP premium portion. As a result, I am paying $125 a month, which is $1,500 a year, for MSP premium for the two of us. I CANNOT AFFORD THIS! This is beyond extortionist! I am paying $15,000 a year for rent, $8,400 a year for food and basic living supplies, $3,600 a year for transportation, and the rest goes to paying student loan and line of credit debt -- debt which I incurred to pay for rent and food when I was unable to find employment and where I had no income. I feel like we are being penalized for being a young low-income couple. If we were living separately, I would be paying $67.50 a month, and her portion due to her lack of income would be $0. But because we live together, now I instantly have to pick up her tab. And additionally, MSP claims that debt cannot be taken into consideration when calculating my monthly premium, so I have no way to reduce the expense to be affordable.

Sixth, when I was fully employed in Ontario and I had an income of $44,000 (in 2012), I paid $575 for health premium to Ontario for that year, and I didn't have to pay any portion for my spouse. She didn't pay any health premium because she had an income of $0. In 2013 and now in BC, with a measly $31,000 income, I am paying $1,500 a year. That's an increase of over almost $1,000 with a relative decrease in income of $13,000! If I was still living in Ontario, and frankly I would still be if I had known about how much I would be paying for MSP in BC before I had moved here, even with an income of $200,000 in Ontario, I would only be paying $900 a year for health premium (source: http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/tax/healthpremium/rates.html). The rates in BC are beyond ludicrous, and are wrongfully penalizing my spouse and I for being a low-income young couple.

My MSP account is delinquent $360.00 right now, and I could care less, because the main focus is for me to pay rent so I'm not homeless next month. I am living in unbearable amounts of stress trying to survive, and MSP is the largest expense I have to pay each month right after rent. But unlike internet service or a cellphone plan, I can't cancel my MSP premium, even when I don't have an income anymore.

Combine this with my chronic depression, which makes it hard for me to get out of bed in the morning and to shower, let alone to maintain a job and an income -- it makes the task of calling and talking with an MSP representative on the phone for half an hour, to inquire about ""temporary income assistance"" or the legitimacy of being charged $125 a month for health premiums in my financial circumstance, impossible for me to deal with.

I plead with you as the Ministry of Health representative of BC to take into consideration the needs of low income youth and couples, like my spouse and I, and to see that our needs are not being represented right now. I ask that you:

1) Fight to make premiums much lower to be in line with those in Ontario and other provinces. I ask that you increase the maximum income allowed, so that the top premium is relative to an income of $80,000 or more, and not a measly $30,000 yearly income.

2) Remove the requirement that a common law couple has one spouse paying the premium for the other spouse. It should not be the responsibility of the sole income earner to be paying for two health premiums. Or, create a separate income-to-premium rate-scale, so that a couple is not rated on the same scale as an individual. If the maximum of $67.50 per month is for an individual at $30,000, then the maximum of $125.00 for a couple should be at $60,000 combined income.

3) I urge you to remove the concept of monthly billing for BC's health premiums, and instead, change the system to bill health premiums like the rest of Canadian provinces -- with the provincial income tax that is to be paid at the end of the year. This will go a long way to reduce stress and offer efficiency for residents. It will also remove all requirements for ""temporary premium assistance"", because you cannot be charged on an income you do not have.

I ask that you take my email seriously into consideration, as without your help, I feel we have no hope but to move to another province so that we can live without the unneeded stress or fear of our accounts being sent to collections. 

Vancouver has many factors that are sending youth and recent graduates to other provinces, including the expensive rent, food and transportation costs. I feel like this would be one of those aspects that could be changed to help keep the youth in BC.

Edit 
re finances.  Have you recently been to the bank for a loan? it's very challenging to get approved, while this is federally imposed, the reason for the high loan amounts is a provincal issue.. does it make sense that a house-hold income of $120,000/year can qualify and expected to pay $600,000-$800,000 ?  

Edit: 
re Politics. I am 40 years old and can recall what is what like to try and buy or rent a home in my early 20's, $50,000/year income. Lack of rent control, mortgage policies, lending policies, restrictions to builders who choose to construct towers for condo sales rather than rental.  Furthermore, lending practices in BC were heavily skewed due to what we know now about money laundering.  I recall losing bid after bid on purchasing a small 500sqft condo to a person who was willing pay cash with no subjects.

Transportation(politics) I watched our BC government ignore the transportation issues that are solved easily by addressing transit issues. This is not impossible, and every major city close to us, including Seattle, have overcome the issues that we face daily. 

BC governments lack of attention and support for small-large businesses
Businesses pay the most taxes which go on to benefits the citizens, as they should, however, if you observe how many head offices are located in Toronto VS Vancouver then you will quickly notice that the bean counters in these multi-million /multi-billion companies are not stupid enough to pay for space in BC as there is no incentive to do so.

"Unfair! BC Speculation and Vacancy tax to be paid by BC residents (not PR or Canadian) even though they work, live, & pay taxes here.","Hi.

Has anybody else here suddenly realised that they have to pay the BC Speculation and Vacancy tax even though last year they were exempt?I'm Canadian, my spouse is a US citizen but has been living here for >5 years and works here and declares and pays income taxes here, i.e. he is a 'BC resident for income tax purposes'. He works as a Prof at a local University. The university actually incentivised us to buy a place in 2016 because they have a mortgage subsidy program giving new faculty 50k to help offset the expensive housing prices and b/c you just don't earn that much money in academia. We've been putting off applying for my spouses permanent residence (PR) because it didn't seem totally necessary since his permanent tenure-track job assures his work permit and visa. Well, and he's been super busy as a new faculty working hard.

I'm exempt from the tax under the principal residence exemption (b/c I'm Canadian).Last year when declaring for the BC Speculation and Vacancy tax my spouse was exempt, too, as a BC resident for income tax purposes; but this year it seems like you have to also be a Canadian or Permanent resident. When we fill out the form we cannot fill it out in a way for him to be exempt. We called and they couldn't help us either. The details in the actual Act are so complicated. I can't understand the legal jargon. When I read the Exemptions for Certain Owners I feel like the act is contradictory; but that language is hard to make sense of.

Him having to pay this tax seems super unfair. He works here, pays taxes here, we live in our place (principal residence) and it's the only place we own. He massively contributes to the community through his job in education and research.

The speculation and vacancy tax ""is designed to discourage housing speculation and people from leaving homes vacant in B.C.’s major urban centres. More than 99% of British Columbians are expected to be exempt from the tax” ([gov.bc.ca](http://gov.bc.ca/)).We're 100% not speculating and our place is not vacant. We were lucky enough to get into the housing market. We actually wouldn't be able to afford our place if had to rent it but paying it off over 30 years is doable since the monthly rate is lower than the rent would be.

I'm a bit clueless on what to do. There are no news articles out there yet mentioning this particular problem.

"Hello /r/vancouver! With a provincial election days away, one issue really bothers me. Disproportionately high housing prices affect a very large number of Vancouverites, yet we don't hear these scumbag politicians talking about it.","Before the bury brigade do what they do best, I want to clarify that I'm not saying that more market regulation is the solution to all of our problems but as Canadian residents and Citizens, we do have the right to affordable housing without being victims of price manipulations (intended or unintended) orchestrated by foreigners (there are other factors, obviously). I acknowledge that Vancouver has a relatively warm climate and beautiful mountains, which can justify higher housing prices to some degree but in reality, *many* condos and houses in Vancouver are bought by wealthy foreigners who keep them empty or rent them out at ridiculously high prices don't care less about the well-being of our society. As a Canadian, is it impolite for me to ask the government to put the brakes on foreign investments in the housing market to let its inhabitants be the masters of their own market?

Here are some rules which I think could help us and I believe their benefits outweigh their consequences for Residents and Citizens.

- Create a special tax for foreign property owners.
- Impose a welcome fee for new foreign owners based on a percentage of the total property value, high enough to discourage them from investing in the housing market unless they really want to live here.
- Make it illegal for landlords ask for a money deposit when Residents and Citizens are renting.
- Rent price hikes should be declined by the tenant (not sure if that's already implemented).
- Make it illegal for landlords to raise the rent by more than 2%/year, regardless if tenants are leaving and new ones arrive.
- Impose a new tax on luxury cars.",Vancouver,2013-05-06 00:08:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/1dra2a/hello_rvancouver_with_a_provincial_election_days/,11
YIMBY Manifesto: why Vancouver needs a housing-based political party,"Hello /r/Vancouver, 

Below is a manifesto I have written for why Vancouver needs to organize a housing-based political party.   This manifesto seeks to inspire others, to generate discussion and to get people thinking.  It echoes off the anger of movements like *#DontHave1Million* and *#HALTYVR*, arguing that we must take a stand against zoning laws that strangle the creation of diverse, affordable housing around Single Family Home (SFH) areas.

**The YIMBY manifesto**

The term ""YIMBY"" stands for Yes In My BackYard, a response to anti-development people nicknamed NIMBY's (Not In 
My Backyard).  The ""YIMBY movement"" is neither a left nor right movement.  The inspiration for this manifesto came from San Francisco's [BARF -- the Bay Area Renters Federation.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html?_r=0)  The NY Times summed up their thinking as:

>[BARF] Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.

>[BARF] supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. “You have to support building, even when it’s a type of building you hate,” she said. “Is it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.”

YIMBY shares the spirit of BARF, but with a Vancouver flavour.  We are in a crisis and we will not get out of it by limiting the expansion of development.  Nor will we get out of it by just caving into developer demands and not ending zoning laws that limit the construction of flexible higher density houses (like duplexes, townhouses, apartments etc).

In Vancouver, the YIMBY Manifesto's primary rally cry is the concern that 95 per cent of Canadian families can not afford to buy a single family home (SFH) in Vancouver, while single family home zoned areas in Vancouver make up 80% of its land area.  Put another way, the top 5% of families are now on an alignment to ""own"" (eventually) 80% of Vancouver's land.  YIMBY believes this core injustice perpetuated by zoning laws working against the interests of the broader public needs to end.  

NPA / Vision / Green can never take the actions that are needed to help younger generations on this issue, due to the intractable conflicts of interests they have with SFH-owning members of society.  Their politics will always invoke an attempt to find balance in ways that privilege home equity values.  If newer generations want to find effective advocates for their interests on this issue, they need to make it clear they are willing to break with older progressive and conservative allies to align together a new coalition that's focused primary *on their economic interests, not those of SFH home owners.*

Because NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) forces among SFH neighbourhoods hold very strong political sway over individual rezoning decisions, including even among traditionally ""progressive"" parties like Vision or Green.  The YIMBY manifesto proposes fighting their strong influence by targeting the system from a higher level by advocating for a bold, proverbial *ripping of the band aid* reform of all zoning laws that limit single family houses from higher density all in one go, where ever possible.  This approach would move the City of Vancouver away from the current wishy-washy incrementalism that has paralyzed effective action on housing affordability.

In most zoning battles, home owners can effectively win as ""NIMBY's"" within zoning battles because renters don't show up to fight these battles.  We believe a city election could be different.  If a battle over zoning philosophy is fought during a city election as the party's primary issue, we create a way for the large vocal interests of non-SFH owning and renting people to gain back their voice.  Home owners who fight against electing YIMBY's with fierce intensity may be shocked to learn just how much built up anger and resentment exists out among those who have had enough with *SFH-privilege.*  These *non-SFH owning* voters are the silent majority, the silent guardians of housing affordability who can make the YIMBY party possible.

**The YIMBY Identity**

A YIMBY political party if created in Vancouver will not function as a regular political party, but more as an organized movement.  Neither left, nor right -- it is for the renters, the dispossessed, the homeless, those who missed out on the single family home lottery, and those who just want a reason to tell the existing order *to go fuck themselves.*

In some ways... it's a Trumpian effort -- minus the bigotry, ignorance and racism -- to #DrainTheSwamp of all of our pathetically ineffective politicians who have gleefully stood by as our city has hollowed itself out.

In other ways, it's a way for new generations to express their anger in highly tangible and effective way: a way for Gen Y and Gen X'ers to truly assert their grievances as many did with Bernie Sanders campaign during the Democratic Primary.

This movement is *screaming protest* against the status quo insanity those with property have subjected on us in Vancouver.  We watch as Gregor feigns sadness about the plight of renters, while gleefully profiting off his own home equity rising.  YIMBY seeks to redefine political norms in ways that shock those among Vancouver's political class.

**Vision, NPA and Green fuck over younger generations**

This manifesto argues a YIMBY-style party is necessary due to the inherent electoral dynamics of how city councils respond to issues of zoning.

The YIMBY is the only party that can fight consistently for the interests of renters.  Unlike NPA / Vision / Green, a YIMBY party is under no pressure to submit to the complaints of SFH owners.  Unlike these parties, YIMBY *will take a side* on these issues in a way that other parties won't.  YIMBY *will not* fiddle *while Vancouver burns* because we know what we want and we will do what it takes to get it.  

**Vancouver issues viewed by a YIMBY**

- YIMBY-ers *will not* mortgage the wellbeing of future generations to protect the paper millionaire profits of those who made wealth through no particular skill or agency of their own.

- YIMBY-ers will reject as a false equivalence anyone who tries to argue that the wellbeing of Kitsilano residents losing a downtown view corridor could ever take precedence over the problem of renters not being able to find a shoebox to rent from downtown in buildings that have had their heights capped. 

- YIMBY-ers know that the choices forced upon them between single family homes and condo shoeboxes are *false dichotomies* created by our leaders craven political inability to allow any [middle housing options](http://imgur.com/R5fhwsM) within SFH suburbs.

- YIMBY'ers know it is *not normal* [for 95 per cent of Canadian families to be priced out of being able to buy a single family home in Vancouver](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/11/21/vancouver-should-prohibit-single-family-home-construction.html), while those land masses within Vancouver occupy 4/5ths of the city's land space. 


**Our Platform: 1 Promise**

The YIMBY campaign platform centers around one concrete platform promise:

>To abolish any and all zoning laws protecting single family houses, to put an end to 95% of our city's population being priced out -- permanently banished  -- from ever being able to own property across 4/5ths of the land in this city.  

The practical effect of this promise will be to see, without getting into the dirty details, an *upzoning of all single family home areas* in Vancouver to support medium density or higher.

All at once.  No exceptions.  No NIMBY special interest carve outs.   

Equal sacrifice for everyone.  So that no NIMBY can argue they are being unfairly targeted.  

And if you don't like duplexes and other forms of gentle density increases cramping your single family house style inside a major city, then too bad:  Move.


**Conclusion**

The YIMBY manifesto is a call to end zoning SFH-privilege.  It recognizes that in the affordable housing debate the most serious changes needed to help struggling renters and potential buyers are changes often directly opposed by those who are interested in preserving home equity.

This tension is one reason for the inability of municipal parties to take strong effective action to cool down Vancouver's housing prices.  Without it, most political will to increase housing supply and availability will be tied to ""safe"" approaches that only tinker around the edges.

The silent majority of Vancouver has had enough.  The YIMBY manifesto realizes that those lacking in SFH-privilege will never receive the adequate political voice that they need until they directly organize together to advance their interests as a group.  This manifesto is also a way for younger generations who have been *betrayed* by progressive members of older generations to fight back.  To gain a voice that represents *their struggles for financial security*, not baby boomer home owners.

It's time for younger generations and other non-property owning people across all generations to organize in ways where they can finally take decisive action to put an end to [single family home zoning insanity](https://twitter.com/ahvancouver/status/800458823081132033) -- our first step towards Making Vancouver Liveable Again by allowing the proliferation of a more diverse housing stock within 80% of our city's land mass.

What's going to happen to AirBNB and the housing market?,"Things are bad right now. It reminds me of 2008. However, as we all know housing wasn't really that impacted. The government is basically doing the same thing that they did in 2008 which is allowing the CMHC to take loans off of the bank's balance sheet. So some of the more risky lenders are now protected and there is liquidity in the market. 

AirBNB poses some interesting unintended consequences. The first is that AirBNB has said over and over that their supply won't affect rents but now there's a ton of supply coming back on the market, at least temporarily. We will have data that will provide a more concrete answer to the question of AirBNB and affordability. 

There's also the issue of leverage in the system. There are lots of ways to leverage yourself in the housing market here. This can be getting a LOC to secure more of a downpayment or using a HELOC to buy another property. The key thing here is that what happens if you used a LOC or a HELOC to buy an AirBNB?

In 2008 it wasn't average people which took down the market, it was the highly leveraged. 

As far as I know, the CMHC is bailing out people who cannot pay because of this pandemic. They are not bailing out AirBNBs or people with multiple properties. It's only on the primary residence. If they did bail these people out, it would create a huge moral hazard. 

Furthermore, if prices decline and Canadians can't buy, then it might be fairly attractive for foreign investors to scoop up all of the property on sale. At least we have the beneficial owner legislation coming in soon. 

What do you think is going to happen to the housing market in the next 6 months. I expect it to rock on as usual. One way or another, prices always go up.",Vancouver,2020-03-31 14:33:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/fsdxxe/whats_going_to_happen_to_airbnb_and_the_housing/,0
"BC home sales drop 35%, price drops 6% month-to-month in May but there's a long way to go to actual affordability.","The housing correction has started, and there are worrisome signs a recession may already be well on its way.

The 35% drop in sales and a 6% month-on-month average price reduction reported for BC in the Financial Times this week are is encouraging news for everyone who has been holding back waiting for home prices to fall. 

[financialpost.com: B .C. home sales drop 35% as rising mortgage rates bite](https://t.co/UQSh9tdBWI)

The news is less welcome for REIT investors, land speculators, recent home buyers on variable-rate mortgages, and all the businesses buying up homes as financial instruments - and I think this is a good thing.

In Canada, 41% of residential property owners own more than one home, and in BC 1 in 6 own more than one home.

[41% of Canadian home owners own more than 1 home](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/multiple-property-holders-own-upwards-152005793.html)

Homeowners are already showing the stress of the increases of interest rates. According to a June 2022 debt survey from Manulife Bank of Canada reported on by CBC, 18 per cent of homeowners polled are already at a stage where they can't afford their homes.

[CBC: Nearly 1 in 4 homeowners would have to sell home if interest rates rise more, according to survey](https://t.co/dCgkuWfyum)

According to the Government of Canada's mortgage affordability tool, at $1,000,000, a single-famlily-home requires a household income of $190,000 per year.

[itools-ioutils.fcac-acfc.gc.ca: Mortgage calculator](https://t.co/DRsfvo93KS)

Only 2% of British Columbia's households earn what it costs to buy a $1,000,000 single-family home without significant equity already in place, according to the Income Percentile Calculator at The KickassEnterpreneur.

[thekickassentrepreneur.com: Income Percentile Calculator by Province for Canada Including 28 Income Statistics - 2022 Data](https://t.co/070fU3baYu)

For comparative reference, over 75% of BC households earn a gross income of $75,000 per year or less. Of course, townhouses and apartments are less expensive than detached single-family homes.  There's a long way to go before BC home prices can return to affordability in the ongoing housing crisis.

The standard definition of affordable rental housing used by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and BC Housing is a rate that is no more than 30% of the household’s gross income. According to the CMHC, In Vancouver where I live, the [average and median household incomes are $96,423 and $72,582](https://www03.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/hmip-pimh/en/TableMapChart/TableMatchingCriteria?GeographyType=MetropolitanMajorArea&GeographyId=2410&CategoryLevel1=Population%2C%20Households%20and%20Housing%20Stock&CategoryLevel2=Household%20Income&ColumnField=HouseholdIncomeRange&RowField=Neighbourhood&SearchTags%5B0%5D.Key=Households&SearchTags%5B0%5D.Value=Number&SearchTags%5B1%5D.Key=Statistics&SearchTags%5B1%5D.Value=AverageAndMedian).    
This means that the rent that an average Vancouver household can afford is therefore **$2,678** per month and the rent that an median Vancouver household can afford is **$2,016** per month.

[According to website Zumpers](https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/vancouver-bc) the median market rents in the city are the following:

1br: $2,300 ; 2br: $3,300 ; 3br: $4,187 ; 4br: $4,950

In other words, the **average household can afford the medial price for a 1-bedroom** **but not for a 2-bedroom**. The **median household can not afford the median price for even a 1-bedroom rental in Vancouver.**

Of the 160,855 households in Vancouver in the 2016 census, there were 135,215 couples (2 adults) and there were 63,945 couples with 1 or more children: 28,895 with 1 child, 27,250 with 2 children, and 7,805 with 3 or more children.

There were also 25,640 one-parent households, 17,315 with 1 child, 6,590 with two, and 1,740 with 3 or more children.

None of the families with children can legally live in a one-bedroom suite. If there are 2 children and they are of different gender, the MCFD and BC Housing stipulate children in a household should be in separate bedrooms, separate from the parents.

Vancouver needs to address the disconnect between the cost of housing and the ability to pay of Vancouver residents.  The city needs to increase the vacancy rate back up to a healthier 3%. The city needs to ensure housing projects being considered bring us closer to affordability and do not take our city further away. And at the same time, people who own homes they live in may need a safety net that helps them weather the storm if property values drop.  
The Provincial and Federal governments need to prioritize people being able to live in homes that they can afford and the City of Vancouver needs to pressure them to do better than they are doing now.  
Finally, City Hall needs to stop talking about affordable housing with any other definition than the definition that Canada's national authority on housing, CMHC, uses. Affordable housing is housing people can afford, and our elected officials need to be clear in their communications to everyone. 

So I'm really interested in hearing what people are thinking about this. Can Vancouver build our way out of this? Does the city need to prioritize what gets built?  How should the city gulf the apparent gap between what we know we need to build and what builders tell us can be built considering the price of land? Are there other ways to get to affordability?

It's no secret I am in the process of seeking a nomination for the 2022 municipal election. I'd love to hear what people's ideas are here so I can think on them within my own party's nomination process.",Vancouver,2022-06-15 20:11:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/vd279u/bc_home_sales_drop_35_price_drops_6_monthtomonth/,7
Some questions from US-NZer moving back to Canada (lived there as a kid) to Vancouver for tech or VFX work.,"**TL;DR** ex Canadian as a kid moving back, needs specific advice for the Vancouver area & returning to Canada in general after being abroad for a long time.

> .

Hey BC, reddit's friendly advice has been quite good for me before, and although this may seem like a retread thread, I've searched a lot and have specific questions on moving back to Canada - particularly Vancouver (though we are kind of considering the Kelowna area for weather reasons, despite that the job market may not be as exciting for me - probably though we may end up moving there from Vancouver down the line). Anyway I have a few questions I didn't see in other similar posts and would be grateful for your advice.

For context, I'm in my late 30s was born in Canada and lived in Alberta as a kid, but from like 7th grade on lived most of my life in the US (most recently in NYC)  but have been living and working in tech & visual effects in NZ for the last several years.  I do have specific questions about moving back to Canada from out of the country with my kiwi fiancé and tiny dog (not the same one btw).

Anyway we are looking for a suburby kind of house (min 2br) with a small private backyard to rent (for at least a year or so before we buy) in a safe-ish mid to upper-middle class neighborhood. I've lived in NYC and loved it when young, but find the older I get i don't have the patience for riffraff ;) & I prefer living in mellow, spacious burbs, hopefully within an hour of the city or places I work so we still can pop in for fun.

I'm fairly experienced in CG & VFX work, character animation & programming as a TD or game dev, but might go contracting in IT programming or as team leader/architect if pickings were thin or salaries were small (not sure if the VFX crash has affected the market there badly).

> .

*Questions include:* (plz answer whatever you can or have time for)
Links to resources that I might not have come across here on reddit are most welcome!

> .

**1)** What's the scoop on getting set up with free healthcare for a Canadian citizen moving back as an adult? Is it comparable to NZ's system? I've been spoiled in NZ as it's so easy and cheap and high quality there that I haven't needed private healthcare and am constantly shocked at the state of healthcare when visiting my family in the US as it seems to have deteriorated drastically since I last lived there.

**2)**  What suburbs work best for tech, VFX or post work where I can still live in a house with a yard? Suburbs must have excellent, reasonably priced Internet as obv any redditor can't live without high speed and I need at least 80Gb/month cap - this isn't a problem there is it? is Burnaby nice?

**3)** We don't have kids yet, but are planning to bring our tiny dog across the world with us (I checked - it seems easy as NZ is recognized by Canada as not having rabies). Is it hard to find a nice rental with a fenced yard that allows a well trained 3kg dog in a suburb as I've described?

**4)** People say Vancouver is a very expensive place to live, but from what I've seen it doesn't seem to be more that what I'm used to with Auckland- rent here for a 4br with 2 car internal garage & a yard in a nice neighborhood is ~NZD$2900 to $3200 per month in AKL so seeing numbers like CAN$1500 to $1900 don't scare me too much. Also, house prices are insanely inflated in NZ and the quality is like substandard from like the 70s USA if you ask me so it will be nice to get back to well-built North American quality housing. Or do I have it all wrong?

**5)** Is setting up a bank account difficult in Canada? Only having lived there as a child, I have no credit in Canada and no idea. Even the US has gotten insanely weird with banking in the last 7years or so that I've been not living there... Any problems setting up accounts and getting Canadian credit cards in this way? I still have to check if there are any tax issues of bringing any money over $10K into Canada if you are a citizen moving back. any ideas with this?

**6)** From reading the immigration websites, it seems I can even bring my kiwi gf/partner common-law/defacto with me without having to get married first; she has both a NZ & British passport - is either preferred for Canadian immigration purposes? I'm assuming she can work if i do it that way as a defacto partner? As we might decide to wait to get married until we are settled a bit and have made enough local friends to invite to our wedding ;)

**7)** Culture-wise, do you think it will be a big shock for me to return to Canada considering I've probably only spent 2 weeks in Vancouver since I lived in Alberta as a kid? Seems like Canada has gotten very conservative lately and have been bummed about that, but wonder if it will be less of a shock than it was for me moving to NZ from NY.  I am very homesick for North America and being back on a continent in my Northern Hemisphere. I'm hoping Vancouver is more Americany (no offense) than Red Deer was when I was a kid.

**8)** One last thing: anyone who has lived in both the Vancouver and Kelowna areas please compare and contrast in context of cost of living and cool jobs and weather, it is my understanding that Kelowna is warmer and does have a few cool employers. I may have a lead at a game dev place in the region and we were somewhat considering Kelowna area primarily based on warmth of climate and quality of life suburby and nice place to raise kids? This may be something we pursue later though and it may be best to work and make money in Vancouver first. Again only been there as a kid so have no idea what it is like now. I get the impression that Kelowna is like a less flaky more high tech Sedona, AZ - is that off the mark?

Thanks heaps (as kiwis say) for any and all advice and relaying your experiences that would help us!!

Open Letter to BC Premier - Christy Clark,"Dear Ms. Clark,

I am not sure what good this letter will do or if my words will make any difference, anyhow, it doesn’t cost to write a letter (atleast not for now it doesn’t), may be in next few months, it may even cost to write a letter like this.

I am not sure where to begin and how to begin, or I can just get down to the facts and state the obvious, which is - An Average BC resident is SCREWED when it comes to real estate! aaaaaannnnnnnddddd I am done! Thank you!

If you are still reading this, then here we go - I have been living in Surrey for last 10 years, have owned real estate and understand seller and buyer sides. Now it worries me and it saddens me to see all this outrage of people who wanted to buy few months back and now they are just stuck. I am positioning this for both Sellers and Buyers. I will not spend time on talking about foreign investors, or flipping, I really just want to understand the situation and but me as an average Canadian, I cannot wrap my head around what has changed in the last 6-9 months really. Why are the prices going up? And if they are going up, are they ever going to come down now? Or are these high prices going to be the new benchmark ? I am sure, a lot of people out there have similar questions and I am sure you get this asked a lot as to what you are really doing about the real estate situation in BC. Now, I saw your speech few days back and some work is going, and let’s see what the outcome is.

In the meantime, let me put things in context for you and I will not use some foreign investor Vancouver teardown scenario (media hype), I am going to use a simple basic suburb scenario, - a friend of mine bought a house in Langley, yes Langley (the one from British Columbia and not the one from USA) for $730,000 in March of 2015, it’s a 3500 sq feet house on a 3400 sq feet lot (yes one of those ones which the city approved), nice beautiful home, good enough for his family. His next door house is very similar (built by the same developer with same type of material), bought few months earlier than his for almost the same price, is now listed at $1.15 Million, yes you read that right, a whoopin $400,000 more than what they bought it for a year ago, I mean even google shares didn’t make this much profit for its shareholders (please don’t quote me on the google share part, I wish I was a google shareholder, may be then I could afford a house in New York, oh I meant Langley).

Long story short, or short story which I already made it long (maybe I should try writing more often or not at all), in order to buy a single family home in Langley and its Langley we are talking about not New York (yes people I compared Langley to New York – sorry New York or I should say sorry Langley), up until few months ago I needed about $150,000 as 20% down, and my mortgage would have been approximately $2500/month and city taxes somewhere around $300/month. Now, with the new price I need atleast $220,000 as 20% down, and the mortgage would be somewhere around $3500/month and city taxes will be somewhere around $400/month. Hmm, I should have bought those google shares when I had the chance.

I wonder if I lost a tooth may be a tooth fairy would give me $50,000 additional for that down payment or maybe I can rent the luxury 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 650 sq feet basement suite for $2500/month, may be that way I will be able to afford my mortgage payments. Yes, screw you tenants, you are only here to pay my mortgage and on the weekends, don’t you dare park in the driveway, go park 6 km away from the house, cause I have guests coming.

Now, that was Buyer’s angle, what about the sellers, well they are making money overnight, aren’t they? Well, not entirely true, if you sell in a market like this, you buy in a market like, whether you decide to downgrade or upgrade, you are paying more money than you would have paid few months back. People selling in Vancouver, are driving the markets in suburbs, they sold their residences for multi million dollars, and now have to move somewhere, and guess what, they pay a higher dime for a newer/bigger home in suburbs, which ends up driving that market. Eventually, the space will saturate. So this vicious circle (btw, I got so passionate writing this, I forgot the spelling of vicious and ended up googling the spellings, ah.. those google shares, every time I search something) will only drive the market up.

Incomes are not going up, gas prices are not down, transportation isn’t cheap, city taxes are going up, the sun only shined 2 days in last 2 weeks, the lululemon pants for men are still $129 + tax (arghhh, they are so good, if only I could afford those fancy pants), then why is it that real estate behavior is all over the place.

I reach out to you as a leader of this province, to tackle this situation, pull a committee together, take some actions, come out with a solution. People are tired of listening to words like foreign investors, flipping and raincouver (I don’t expect you to stop the rain, may be you can, I don’t know you personally). Lets talk about this in open, lets highlight the weakness and strengthen the confidence in people. 

Please do something about it and if somehow this reaches you, then I thank you for all that you are doing but we need more! 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

YIMBY Manifesto: why Vancouver needs a housing-based political party.,"Hello /r/Vancouver, 

Question:  **Should Vancouverites who care about housing affordability issues create their own political party to contest the Vancouver City municipal election?**

-----------------------------

Half-joking, half-serious.  In response to this idea... I've hastily written a manifesto/rant as a template for organizing a political movement like this.  It seeks to inspire others in Vancouver.  To generate discussion and to get people thinking.  It echoes off the anger of movements like #DontHave1Million and #HALTYVR, making a strong case for how to prevent zoning laws from strangling the creation of more flexible diverse housing around SFH areas.

**Introduction to the YIMBY manifesto**

The term YIMBY stands for Yes In My BackYard, a response to anti-development people nicknamed NIMBY's.  The ""YIMBY movement"" is neither a left nor right movement.  Its inspiration here for this manifesto is heavily borrowed from SF's [BARF -- the Bay Area Renters Federation.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/business/economy/san-francisco-housing-tech-boom-sf-barf.html?_r=0)  The NY Times summed up their thinking as:

>[BARF] Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more market-rate rentals, more high-end condominiums.

>[BARF] supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. “You have to support building, even when it’s a type of building you hate,” she said. “Is it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it low-income housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now.”

YIMBY shares the spirit of BARF, but with a Vancouver flavour.  We are in a crisis and we will not get out of it by limiting the expansion of development.  Nor will we get out of it by just caving into developer demands, without actually freeing up more broadly all zoning laws that are limiting the construction of flexible housing units like duplexes, etc.

In Vancouver, our primary rally cry is the concern that 95 per cent of Canadian families can not afford to buy a single family home (SFH) in Vancouver, while single family home zoned areas in Vancouver make up 80% of its land area.  Put another way, the top 5% of families are now on an alignment to ""own"" (eventually) 80% of Vancouver's land.  YIMBY believes this core injustice perpetuated by zoning laws working against the interests of the broader public needs to end.  

NPA / Vision / Green can never take the actions that are needed to help younger generations on this issue, due to the intractable conflicts of interests they have with SFH-owning members of society.  Their politics will always invoke an attempt to find balance in ways that privilege home equity values.  If newer generations want to find effective advocates for their interests on this issue, they need to make it clear they are willing to break with older progressive allies to align together a new coalition that's focused primary *on their econonic interests, not those of SFH home owners.*

Because NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) forces among SFH neighbourhoods hold very strong political sway over individual rezoning decisions, including even among traditionally ""progressive"" parties like Vision or Green.  The YIMBY manifesto proposes fighting their strong influence by targeting the system from a higher level by advocating for a bold, proverbial *ripping of the band aid* reform of all zoning laws that limit single family houses from higher density all in one go, where ever possible.  This approach would move the City of Vancouver away from the current wishy-washy incrementalism that has paralyzed effective action on housing affordability.

In most zoning battles, home owners can effectively win as ""NIMBY's"" within zoning battles because renters don't show up to fight these battles.  We believe a city election could be different.  If a battle over zoning philosophy is fought during a city election as the party's primary issue, we create a way for the large vocal interests of non-SFH owning and renting people to gain back their voice.  Home owners who fight against electing YIMBY's with fierce intensity may be shocked to learn just how much built up anger and resentment exists out among those who have had enough with *SFH-privilege.*  These *non-SFH owning* voters are the silent majority, the silent guardians of housing affordability who can make the YIMBY party possible.

**The YIMBY Identity**

A YIMBY political party if created in Vancouver will not function as a regular political party, but more as an organized movement.  Neither left, nor right -- it is for the renters, the dispossessed, the homeless, those who missed out on the single family home lottery, and those who just want a reason to tell the existing order *to go fuck themselves.*

In some ways... it's a Trumpian effort -- minus the bigotry, ignorance and racism -- to #DrainTheSwamp of all of our pathetically ineffective politicians who have gleefully stood by as our city has hollowed itself out.

In other ways, it's a way for new generations to express their anger in highly tangible and effective way: a way for Gen Y and Gen X'ers to truly assert their grievances as many did with Bernie Sanders campaign during the Democratic Primary.

This movement is *screaming protest* against the status quo insanity those with property have subjected on us in Vancouver.  We watch as Gregor feigns sadness about the plight of renters, while gleefully profiting off his own home equity rising.  YIMBY seeks to redefine political norms in ways that shock those among Vancouver's political class.

**Vision, NPA and Green fuck over younger generations**

This manifesto argues a YIMBY-style party is necessary due to the inherent electoral dynamics of how city councils respond to issues of zoning.

The YIMBY is the only party that can fight consistently for the interests of renters.  Unlike NPA / Vision / Green, a YIMBY party is under no pressure to submit to the complaints of SFH owners.  Unlike these parties, YIMBY *will take a side* on these issues in a way that other parties won't.  YIMBY *will not* fiddle *while Vancouver burns* because we know what we want and we will do what it takes to get it.  

**Vancouver issues viewed by a YIMBY**

- YIMBY-ers *will not* mortgage the wellbeing of future generations to protect the paper millionaire profits of those who made wealth through no particular skill or agency of their own.

- YIMBY-ers will reject as a false equivalence anyone who tries to argue that the wellbeing of Kitsilano residents losing a downtown view corridor could ever take precedence over the problem of renters not being able to find a shoebox to rent from downtown in buildings that have had their heights capped. 

- YIMBY-ers know that the choices forced upon them between single family homes and condo shoeboxes are *false dichotomies* created by our leaders craven political inability to allow any [middle housing options](http://imgur.com/R5fhwsM) within SFH suburbs.

- YIMBY'ers know it is *not normal* [for 95 per cent of Canadian families to be priced out of being able to buy a single family home in Vancouver](http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/11/21/vancouver-should-prohibit-single-family-home-construction.html), while those land masses within Vancouver occupy 4/5ths of the city's land space. 


**Our Campaign Platform: 1 Promise**

The YIMBY campaign platform centers around one concrete platform promise:

>To abolish any and all zoning laws protecting single family houses, to put an end to 95% of our city's population being priced out -- permanently banished  -- from ever being able to own property across 4/5ths of the land in this city.  

The practical effect of this promise will be to see, without getting into the dirty details, an *upzoning of all single family home areas* in Vancouver to support medium density or higher.

All at once.  No exceptions.  No NIMBY special interest carve outs.   

Equal sacrifice for everyone.  So that no NIMBY person can argue they are being unfairly targeted.  

And if you don't like duplexes and other forms of gentle density increases cramping your single family house style inside a major city, then too bad:  Move.


**Conclusion**

The YIMBY manifesto is a call to end zoning SFH-privilege.  It recognizes that in the affordable housing debate the most serious changes needed to help struggling renters and potential buyers are changes often directly opposed by those who are interested in preserving home equity.

This tension is one reason for the inability of municipal parties to take strong effective action to cool down Vancouver's housing prices.  Without it, most political will to increase housing supply and availability will be tied to ""safe"" approaches that only tinker around the edges.

The silent majority of Vancouver has had enough.  The YIMBY manifesto realizes that those lacking in SFH-privilege will never receive the adequate political voice that they need until they directly organize together to advance their interests as a group.  This manifesto is also a way for younger generations who have been *betrayed* by progressive members of older generations to fight back.  To gain a voice that represents *their struggles for financial security*, not baby boomer home owners.

It's time for younger generations and other non-property owning people across all generations to organize in ways where they can finally take decisive action to put an end to single family housing [zoning insanity](https://twitter.com/ahvancouver/status/800458823081132033) -- our first step towards Making Vancouver Liveable Again by allowing the proliferation of a more diverse housing stock within 80% of our city's land mass.

moving to BC from ON. Help us narrow down locations please!,"I have received an opportunity to relocate to the west coast for work. I'll be working for the same company, 99% of the time remotely, so commute isn't a big deal for me, but for my fiancee she'll need to find a new job there. My fiancee and I would be moving (no kids yet but soon) and we do have a choice as to where to go due to the remoteness of my position.

We're both 30. Shes Canadian born Korean and I'm a white guy. We like snowboarding, surfing, opera, museums, art, city life (in moderation), pubs, water, mountains. Home life we like our privacy but dont want to be in the middle of nowhere. 30-90 min drive from a major city would be fine. We're night owls, things being open late is good. We think Toronto is one of the greatest cities of Canada, but we would rather the nature aspect first and the city second or third even. So we think the West coast is better for us. I've been to Vancouver a lot for work trips a week or so here and there, as well as whistler on snowboarding trips a lot and once to Kelowna. 

My salary would be somewhere between 110 and 125K annually. Could add another 40-50k for her to that and thats what we're looking at. She's an Editor in a big publishing company, not sure what types of jobs there are in that field out west but shes not set on that field either.

We'd want to buy a house eventually but to start with we think renting but my questions to you all would be, based on our lifestyle, where would be a cozy safe place to live. What cities?/Towns etc...

We initially thought the island, Victoria or Nanaimo would be a good fit. But after reading up on them more, I'm thinking not so much. I've been to Nanaimo a few times. I like it but I think being that remote would grind us down over time and we'd rather visit out there instead.

So that leaves the main land. I know real estate prices are ridiculous these days. They are here in Toronto too. I think its comparable really. Can get some pretty crappy and / or small places in Toronto for over a million bucks these days. Luckily we don't WANT to live right in the city, definitely don't want to live downtown Van or that close to be honest. We'd prefer a detached house. Not a huge and a decent back yard for a small dog and maybe a pool. Doesn't need to be brand new or anything, I'm quite handy as well. We both have cars so we can be outside the major cities. But we're still young, we like a bit of nightlife once or twice every other month. A few good restaurants to hit up throughout the week.

Right now we live in the Etobicoke area of the GTA. If anyone knows that area, we'd like something kinda similar there. We just don't know the Greater Van area so we don't know what the suburbs are like there. I've read to avoid Surrey and a few others for crime reasons etc.. so... Whistler would be cool to live in for a bit at first, but it seems most if not all places are so cramped and tiny that I donno if it would be more stress to live there due to not being able to make noise ever. I know the townhouses there well since I've stayed in them on trips pretty often. Never looked for a longer term rental though.

Again we aren't particularly tied to Vancouver. Been seeing New Westminster, Maple Ridge, Mission, Port Hardy, Chilliwhack, Kelowna, Delta, Saanich, North Van come up a lot in other posts, but without really knowing these places other than a google maps search for its location, its hard to know if any of them really fit into what we're looking for. 


Where's good places to look to buy? But also to rent for when we first get there? What sites do people normally use for rentals there? 

Thanks for any info!

I just find out I spent more than 3K on wireless bill and internet in 2017. Seriously? Is this normal?,"So you know, new year right, I did some sum ups about what I spent and how much I spent last year. Most Utilities, though expensive but still I can live with. Power, gas, yeh yeh all raised up fine fine.

Until I saw my cellphone and internet cost with company start with T.

More than 3K?!

I just moved to BC last year and have to say it’s a family plan so I pay for two person. I asked for 7G data shared with both people. And 50M home internet. I admit I didn’t choose the cheaper plan since I do need that data. 

But seriously, 3000?? Just for cellphone and internet? And for the sake it is 2017 and it’s not unlimited and it is not Fiber internet?? What’s wrong with this country??

Is this normal? Everyone know we are paying most expensive cellphone bills on earth. But in this kind of level??

Seriously Canadian people I really hope you should get angry. Be more care about your own rights and money! About those so called big companies. About those basic service providers. About those parties who really ripped you off. But not to some poor landlord on the forum. 

Take a look at our Telecom. Take a look at our banking service. Try use Equifax and TransUnion to see if you really can buy your credit report without getting into bunch of useless Monitor services.

And you lived all happily with that and suddenly an asia guy can’t speak English and want to rent his house to who he can communicate with become someone you can’t lived on with.

Pathetic.

Still. This is not a post about that asia landlord. I just feel been ripped off and want to know if anyone feels same as I do. This is not the first time I have this feeling in 2017. Equifax leaking information and to Canadian just an notice without any real meaning. Sears closed up and using fake price at last minute to grab more money from customers supported them for decades. Timmy pay nothing to the employees who take leave. Not mention my personal experiences with some big bank. The list can go on.

What’s wrong?

Honest question about the rent and property price frenzy,"I'll lay my bias out here - i am Canadian, a Vancouverite; I moved away for work and have been doing pretty well outside of my home country. I recently bought a place in Vancouver and am renting it out. For me it's an investment into my home country that, while not making me money at the moment, is part of my nest egg.  
I see foreign buyers in Vancouver as a pretty good thing because of the millions (or billions if the hysteria is to be believed) of dollars that the buyers bring into the Canadian economy. I can even sort of understand blaming the foreign money for driving up housing prices even though i'm part of the problem.  
But now with the rental market going so crazy (anecdotal bidding war evidence), surely we have to realise that it's not just foreigners to blame for the housing crisis. Doesn't this latest issue just mean that there are very simply more people wanting to live in Vancouver than there is space for?

What am i missing? I'd like someone to enlighten me to the current thinking",Vancouver,2016-07-09 07:48:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/4rz8gq/honest_question_about_the_rent_and_property_price/,0
Would the government bailout homeowners in the event of a huge recession?,"Is housing too big to fail?

Personally, home ownership was always just out of reach and I have always rented. I have saved and one day I think I'll be able to afford a home. With all of the taxes and legislation like B20, some softness has come to the market. In a perfect bad storm, housing could fall a lot. I'm not saying it's going to fall, however, if multiple bad things happen to the market, it could really drop.  


Then I realized that because so many Canadians, British Columbians, and specifically Vancouverites have so much wealth in housing, that a moderate to severe downturn would be devastating. Would the government bail out these homeowners or would they let these people fail?  


Personally, I have made huge gains and huge losses in my investments. I know that whenever I invest in something, I could potentially lose everything. The same is true for a real estate investment. It's possible to buy a property and have it not be profitable. I don't wish that on anyone, but it is just part of life. Some investments pay off and others don't.  


Let's say, for example, the worst happens. We have another major recession where nobody is spending and housing drops 50-70% (similar to 1982). People are foreclosing and declaring bancrupsy left right and center. Will the government let these people fail or is housing too important to the economy to let this happen?  


Even in this instance, buyers will fill the void. If prices fall, would the next BC government relax taxes and money laundering rules to get house prices back up?   


Let me know your thoughts. Personally, I think a bailout would be considered, but in the end, the government would let people fail.   


PS. I don't wish any misfortune to anyone. However, the market is the market and any investment can make or lose money. That's just life. ",Vancouver,2019-01-13 17:34:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/afkxf5/would_the_government_bailout_homeowners_in_the/,1
How many vacant condos and freeholds are there in Vancouver / GVRD ? (i.e. excluding rentals of all kinds),"I've been trying for some time to dig up some hard numbers on this and it's rather difficult. Everyone has their pet theories about housing prices but at the end of the day the supply of apartments has to somehow be low relative to people in order for any of them to make sense. There doesn't seem to be a dearth of new constructions and [rental vacancies  are at an all time low](http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/odpub/esub/64467/64467_2011_A01.pdf?fr=1325026654953) so either I am missing a major part of this or there are lot of vacant apartments out there that aren't being rented out or selling - they are simply waiting for the bubble to get higher. 

Once again, **excluding rentals of all kinds**, i.e. rental buildings or rented condos. 

I did find some data on ""absorption rates"" but they seem to only measure new completions and how long the initial sale lasts. If people are buying these places and leaving them vacant this would not be reflected in such stats (and that's exactly what I'm looking for).

Can we get a conversation going about wages and living in Vancouver from people outside of IT?,"Most threads I poke my nose into about job scarcity or shit wages, living expenses, rental availability, etc, always seem to boil down to people talking about IT positions and how those people are navigating everything. I don’t want to discredit their problems, but complaining about Vancouver/Toronto paying low wages for IT when low wages are >65,000usd is not the same conversation, respectfully.

How are people in trades doing in this city? What about service positions? What about people with careers that don’t require them to commute downtown where they’re not paid enough to live close to? I want to get an idea about the REST of the workforce.

Hi, I’m Realmealdeal, I’m 27, and I am a pump specialist living in north Burnaby commuting to Pitt meadows and working all over the lower mainland. I’ve managed to find a unique and cheap rental situation that I love. I make >60k a year and am expected to say yes to any overtime, of which there is plenty (including weekends). Due to the bubble and commute times I don’t think I could own my own home for a longgggg time, but I don’t see it as an impossibility, though it may require leaving the area.

I don’t really feel the struggle that is talked about in many of these situations, but I’m willing to accept that I’ve either lucked out or stayed ahead of the curve by working so much or both. How are others doing? Are some trades bombing while others boom? How are kitchen and serving staff fairing? Delivery drivers? Personal trainers and health experts? Medical staff? Municipal workers? 

I am really just curious for a snapshot into the state of the rest of the Canadian/Vancouver workforce. 



ALSO- if any older redditors who feel like they’ve seen enough to know a thing or two about a thing or two want to chime in with some things to watch out for or what to expect in the coming years as per certain sectors picking up or dropping off that would be really appreciated too, thanks!

ORIGINAL POST:

I just moved here a little over a year ago for my job. Everyone told me it was going to be expensive but I never thought it would be unaffordable. 


""Vancouver is so progressive and hospitable"" I thought. ""there is no way its THAT bad. Someone would have done something about it""

Fast forward to now.


I originally took the first place I could get thinking I would find something better once I am there and in a better situation. I have been looking for 4.5 entire months now (morning and night) and I have ONE place that is better than living in a car and there were soo many applicants. I did not get picked. I do have a lot of emails from people who are ""working in the petroleum industry and had to move their family to the states and are looking for someone to take care of their house..."".... 


 I make less than $35,000 in my dream job that I went to school for ($90,000 tuition debt) which I am aggressively paying and half of my income goes to rent. HALF! I have a second job on the weekends to help pay my debt and eat but I'm still only left less than $100 for savings. It will take me 15 - 20 years to save enough for a down payment on a house costing $300,000.... 20 YEARS to afford by that time a 650 sq foot apartment in a shitty area and I will be 50 YEARS OLD!!! and that is as long as I don’t get married or have kids :/


Now there has to be some secret to this that I am just not getting. All of you are doing it, living, able to save for houses and kids and marriage and go to school and work... and own a car... how?! how are you doing it!

**The arrival:**  
Arrived here with my wife and two dogs on a two week temporary rental offered by lovely elderly couple. This costed us $700. We met another Brazilian guy who had just moved here and agreed that if I found a 2 bedroom place we would sublet one for him. I went apartment hunting and found a 2 bedroom on Main Street for $1800, wrote a very honest introduction letter to the landlord, including that we had two small, quiet dogs and never had any problems with them, and also telling the whole story of how and why we ended up here,  a financial statement proving that we would have no trouble affording the rent, and that we would be subletting one room to a friend, making it even less likely that we would end up not able to pay rent.

**The second year:**  
We rented a one bedroom on 11th and Kingsway for $2100, just me and my wife this time. Both of us were already working in our desired fields.

**3rd year**  
We were feeling very lonely and my wife was really missing her sister. We started planning to move her sister here with her husband and daughter. We paid college for her sister to move here and prepared their immigration strategy.

**4th Year**  
Well this is where we are now, going towards the end of the 4th year. We are a 5 people family living happily, working in what we love the most. This year we started saving to buy a house.

Here we are able to give back to the community where we live with no fears of being kind and having it used against us as it was the case in Brazil.

All I can say is that planning, strength and most importantly being honest was key for this to work.

When you submit comments online, council gets a copy of everyone's comments, along with a count of those supporting the change and those opposed. It'd be helpful for them to know that lots of people are paying attention.

Background info:

Lack of housing in Greater Vancouver, especially rental housing, is driving up housing costs and making us poorer. We've got a huge mismatch between jobs and housing: basically we're adding jobs faster than we're adding housing. It's like musical chairs, with lower-income renters getting pushed out, or worse, into poverty and homelessness.

High housing costs make us poorer, by lowering our real incomes. I can't count the number of people who say that they have a six-figure income, but in Vancouver they still feel poor. Everyone feels stretched to the limit. There's no way they can pay for higher property tax or a parking permit. Even long-time homeowners feel like they're being pushed out: the only way they're going to benefit from their massive gains on paper is if they sell and move elsewhere.

When rents are high, people want to build more rental housing. Right now the bottleneck is that each and every rental project requires a rezoning, which means time-consuming closed-door negotiations with city staff, followed by a public hearing with vocal opposition from people worried about neighbourhood impacts, and ratification by city council.

A majority on city council almost always votes yes in the end, but the whole process takes a very long time.

The proposed change would make six-storey rental buildings legal on certain major streets close to local shopping areas, without requiring a rezoning. The affected streets are shown [on this map, in pink](https://morehousing.ca/streamlining-rental/). This would save a huge amount of everyone's time.

Public support for more rental buildings is surprisingly high: according to a [2019 poll](https://researchco.ca/2019/06/21/our-house-in-the-middle-of-our-street/), 70% of Vancouverites support four- and six-storey rental buildings in residential neighbourhoods. I don't want to dismiss the concerns of people who are worried about over-crowding and public services being overwhelmed, but using high housing costs to keep newcomers out is a double-edged sword: over time, all your neighbours are going to be replaced with rich people, because they're the only ones who can afford it. A better approach is to build up public services to accommodate the larger population in the neighbourhood.

City council is divided, with four consistent Yes votes in favour of more housing (Kennedy Stewart, Christine Boyle, Lisa Dominato, Melissa De Genova), three consistent No votes (Jean Swanson, Adriane Carr, Colleen Hardwick), and four Maybes (Sarah Kirby-Yung, Michael Wiebe, Pete Fry, Rebecca Bligh). Last time this came up for a vote, in July 2020, [council voted to postpone it](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/dan-fumano-postpone-and-delay-vancouver-council-defers-rental-housing-incentives) by a 6-5 vote, with three of the four Maybes (Wiebe, Fry, and Bligh) voting to postpone. On Tuesday we'll see if at least two of the Maybes are willing to vote yes.

"More Housing: AMA, Sunday November 5","TLDR: [Vancouver needs more housing](https://morehousing.ca). I ran for Vancouver city council in last month's election. [Stump speech](https://morehousing.ca/fear). I didn't win ... but I did get more votes than Colleen Hardwick. AMA.

---

I'm a Redditor who tries to persuade people that we need more housing. I've got a blog, [morehousing.ca](https://morehousing.ca). Now that the municipal election is over, I figured I'd do an AMA.

If you have any questions about why housing in Vancouver is so scarce and expensive, and what to do about it, feel free to ask me. I'll spend Sunday answering as many questions as I can.

We've got a severe mismatch between housing and jobs. People move to Vancouver because the jobs are here. The scarcity and cost of housing acts like a filter: the only people who can afford to move here are people with high-income jobs. When they find a place to live, other people are pushed down the housing ladder. People near the bottom of the ladder are under tremendous pressure: they're forced to leave, to crowd into substandard housing, or worst of all, they become homeless. And Covid has aggravated the problem, with a lot more people suddenly working from home, boosting total demand for residential space.

It's a terrible situation for renters, but it's also bad for homeowners. They don't benefit from their gains on paper unless they sell, and then where would they live? Where are their kids going to live? How well is the health-care system going to work when hospitals can't hire nurses and doctors?

We have people who want to live and work here, and other people who want to build housing for them. **Why is it so difficult to get permission?**

The basic problem is that although we desperately need more housing, there's also a fair number of people who fear and oppose new housing. I get it - it's human nature to fear the unknown - but the terrible scarcity of housing is making us all poorer and worse off.

So what can we do about it? Whenever your local city council is making a decision on whether to add more housing or not, it'd really help if you can **submit a brief message of support**. Council gets lots of messages opposing new housing, so it's important to counterbalance that. It takes literally 30 seconds. I'll try to put together a post whenever there's a major decision coming up in the city of Vancouver.

There's a local organization, Abundant Housing Vancouver, that advocates for more housing, and a larger informal pro-housing community based on a Discord server.

A couple recent examples of housing decisions:

* The [Streamlining Rental Plan passed](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qihjbc/its_easier_to_elect_a_pope_than_to_approve_a/) in December 2021 (after being postponed by a 6-5 vote in July 2020), making six-storey rental buildings legal near local shopping areas.
* The [Broadway Plan passed](https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/tjechx/more_housing_help_counterbalance_opponents_who/) in June 2022, allowing more high-rises near the new SkyTrain stations (although each project will still require rezoning), while [protecting renters](https://morehousing.ca/broadway-plan-protecting-renters) in the area. The target is about 1000 more apartments per year.

In last month's municipal election, I ran for Vancouver city council, with Kennedy Stewart and Forward Together. I didn't get elected, but I did get more votes than Colleen Hardwick, the anti-growth mayoral candidate. She only got about 10% of the vote. [2022 election results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Vancouver_municipal_election), via Wikipedia. I'm hopeful that the [new council](https://morehousing.ca/abc) will be able to move forward on housing.

I know people are skeptical of politicians and political partisans; I try to be as objective as possible in what I write.

Why is this lack of housing affordability politically acceptable?,"In Australia, there's cross-party support for a huge decline in immigration numbers. Note that I'm not complaining about immigrants, but an influx of people absolutely has an effect on demand, period. Ideally the housing supply wouldn't be fucked for a variety of other reasons too, however. 

In New Zealand they fight it by preventing non-Kiwis from buying Kiwi homes. In the US, they fight it by moving inter-state. In most of Europe the powers that be attempt to offer affordable housing. In Japan they offer a lottery system for entering Soviet-style affordable housing with rent tied to wages. 

In Hong Kong, freedom is an illusion and nothing can be built without CCP shenanigans and depravity.  

It seems like in Canada we're just being told ""too bad"". It feels closer to the Hong Kong ""solution"" than that of most developed countries. Immigration is expected to pick up to the hundreds of thousands once more, with most settling in desirable places like Vancouver, Calgary or Toronto. Last but not least, people on the right (and sometimes left although it's more rare) resort to NIMBYism if shit is built within a 20-kilometre radius.",Vancouver,2021-10-22 19:16:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/qdmuxs/why_is_this_lack_of_housing_affordability/,22
Renting in Vancouver - This city is becoming progressively more unlivable,"We all know about buy a home in Vancouver / Burnaby.... 

But forget about buying, people who are trying to rent are struggling. Here is a little story about me and my ex-roommate:

Around a bit more than one year ago, we were both kicked out of our original place because the landlord wanted to ""renovate"". We both know that she wanted to up the price seeing the renting market is hot. Whatever, we moved out.

Anyways, my renting budget is quite decent for one person i would say ($1300 - $1600). It took me 3 months to get a decent place lined up. It is a studio for $1500, enough said. And you know what, I am afraid of looking around. Last time it was already rough (either people don't have to work, or they just have so much money that they straight up paying 30% more). 

My ex-roommate actually run into a worse situation. He took over a friend's contract early on, and we thought that he got lucky. But now the landlord refuses to renew the contract, again. They also want to ""renovate"" and charge more. This is the second time this happened to him in like 1.5 years.

We are not even complaining about home prices being unreasonable. We just want to survive, and I even have a really good job. This city is not making it easy for us.

This is really getting out of control. Can the government actually do anything meaningful about our living space, for both buyer and renter?

"Returning to CA after 10+ yrs suffering in the US, relocating to Van for a job. So many questions","This sub paints a pretty grim picture of living in Vancouver, but I'm a liberal Canadian who has been living in the bowels of Red State US for 11 years, and we've been offered a chance to get TF out. I know it's not all sunshine and cherry blossoms, but I live in a hellscape and I desperately want to go back to Canada.

It *seems* like a good move, but I have a lot of questions that I hope you all can answer.

Our info:

* In our late 30's

* No kids

* Two dogs (border collies)

* Love parks, hiking, outdoors (necessary for the dogs)

*  Prefer transit/walking to driving

* We have a car (for now)


Job offer is for **140/150k CAD** (waiting to hear back on final offer) located near the Stadium–Chinatown station.

We'd prefer to live somewhere within walking distance of a SkyTrain station (train commute time doesn't matter) or a 30 min bus ride away. We need a small yard/grassy area/dog run for the dogs to do their business (shared is fine, we pick up after them). One is a puppy, so scheduled potty walks won't be enough.

My questions:

* **Is 140-150k a year enough** to live comfortably + get a rental that would suit the dogs? (we don't care how nice it is, just needs to meet their needs)

* Excluding housing, **what's the average monthly expenses** in Van? (Food, utilities, phone, internet, transit passes, parking at our rental, etc)

* We have **>45k CAD in student loans** (between us) to pay off, will we have enough left over to make serious payments on these?

* **How does health insurance work?** Seriously WTF. In ONT, I just had an OHIP card and didn't pay anything, so I'm mystified. Do we pay for insurance there? Does the employer? 


Any insight would be much appreciated, as well as anything that tends to blindside newcomers.

Landlord Moved in 2 Minors Into My Suite,"Hi r/vancouver, the Craziest shit has happened to me over the past 24 hours.

\- I (23M) get a text yesterday afternoon that my landlord moved in two students into my suite of 3 bedrooms. Originally she had called on Sunday, told me she wanted to show the place with less time given to notify me and I said of course but did not say anything about renting the place out to randoms. So Iḿ like alright they can't be that bad,.

\- I get home later and they aren´t there my landlord is and she says ¨oh yeah they are 17¨, apparently they are homestays studying English in Vancouver, I asked if that's legal and she said yes. So I am like wtf, I clean up, move my stuff for them to store their stuff in the fridge, bathroom etc. I hear one arrive and he's along with 3 people with just a bag of groceries, I open my door to greet him and see 4 people. Originally I had thought one of them was the 2nd roommate but it wasn´t he had brought 3 maskless minors into my house. So I call my landlord and tell her he has 3 others over, she tries to call him so I call her and she talks to him on my phone, tells her they are leaving, but 20 minutes later they are still there, so I call her again, mentions the other roommate is not there, she texts the roommate with friends over again to get them out, two leave but one stayed so I walked out introduced myself again and said are you \*nameless\* he said no so I told him he has to leave, and he hesitantly sits still and after about 5 times he finally gets up and gets out.

\- I wanted to make amends with the new roommate so I say ¨Look that was not how I wanted to meet you, but you bringing in 3 friends right away is pretty selfish¨ ( I got COVID from my last roommate so I am super COVID safe) and he said yeah I agree but don´t call the landlord to complain, I said well I have no clue who you are and you didn´t even say hi to me you all stared at me for a good minute and didn´t say anything (it was almost like the kid was shocked I was there).

\- So I get to know him a bit, tell him the rules and the other roommate walks in now. I explain quiet hours in the house are 11PM - 7 AM and the chores list, what's yours, where you can put your stuff and the other kid is laughing at me. I realize he's high, I ask and he admits to it (honestly nothing really wrong with that until he pulled out his weed pen and smoked it in front of me, but they are minors so not good). I explain they can´t have friends over and to relate a bit I said you can have a friend over but in your room and if they are in your circle not like 4 people and all maskless in the kitchen area. I also mention I had COVID so I do not want to get it again and I would like to see my sick grandfather at the hospital before he passes and not be a risk to him. The other roommate laughs and I say what's so funny about that and he says ¨Oh I have had COVID 2 times, it is just like the flu, I really don´t care about it to be honest¨, that there just scared the shit out of me, my landlord doesn´t give me any notice that they are moving two MINORS into the suite I live in, but also both clearly lack any COVID safety and do not respect rules.

\- After that, I went to bed and even though I told them quiet hours are 11 - 7 they were both signing and talking in the common area till at least 2 am.

\- I tried to call my landlord this morning but it went to voicemail twice, and then I texted them both and only one replied with ¨I understand your concern. They moved in yesterday and we're getting settled¨ (BS) ¨Yes they had friends over to help settle. We will mention to them about vaping and if they having friends over they all need masks. They will not be moving today as you live in shared accommodation. I will be in contact with them¨.

\- So like now I am stuck in this situation where my landlord does not care about my health or safety, and I am trying to get out.

\- My rent is month to month and I only rent the room out, **the landlord is not on the premisises** and not the whole space so I don´t think I can do anything legally to be honest. If anyone knows anywhere that is renting out for April or early move in please DM me asap. I just need to get out and I feel trapped and scared about my health.

"Thoughts from an expat (or, why we chose to not move back)","Hey, 



Long time lurker, first time poster here. 



First off, this isn't a rant or a slag, merely a story to share after reading many ""I want to move to Vancouver"" threads. 



Backstory. Born and raised in Vancouver (Kits area), met wife to be, married, moved (in 93) and spent 10 years outside of Fredericton, NB, then three in Halifax, NS and finally, the last eight in Ottawa, ON.



Last winter was long. Have the clothes, have the winter stuff, but weeks of -20 made us think, let's look at moving back and make a lifestyle change and be close to my family again. Our kids are out of the house, we are around 50, both have gov't jobs. 



I go to Vancouver several times a year, and have since I moved away, I follow this sub, plus read the news, so well aware of changes, etc. 



My background. 20+ years in the interactive web space - started in development, moved to account management, now in a Sr/Mgr/Director level role. So, some chops. Good references. Solid experience. etc. So, I only applied for jobs that were a solid fit. Worked LinkedIn, contacts, etc. 



Started the job hunt in March. Spent four months hunting, and 30+ applications later, I got two PFOs (please f#$% off), and one phone interview. And that's it. My wife had better results, but  the pay didn't match the experience. And at this stage of our lives, it should. 



I speculate I had two strikes against me ... one, location (although I stressed I have family in town and starting quickly wouldn't be an issue - plus, first interview could be skype), the second, being senior level (and in government). Talking to colleagues, they all said that would ring as being ""expensive"". I was looking for no less than 90k start. Which would have been a pay cut. 



Now, the big eye opener, pay. I've read that it's lower, but boy, once I got into the research, and checking with colleagues in Vancouver, I was surprised at how much. On average, similar fitting jobs were running around 70-80k, tops. Given the costs in the city, that big a pay cut was not worth it. So, a warning sign. 



We currently live in a 2200sqft house about 30 minutes (by bicycle - 15 by car on a normal drive) from downtown Ottawa (12km). House would roughly sell for around500k. So we used distance as a guide as to where to look (and, knowing the city, we knew where we wanted to be - think roughly an area like 16th and MacDonald over to Main, down to False Creek ... with some flexibility). We also looked broader if it was on a Skytrain line - but not one that was too bus dependant to get to the Skytrain as that just adds time. We planned on being car free, and walking, biking, transiting or car-sharing.  



I want to stress that we were NOT looking for same type of living arrangement. I've been watching real estate for years, I know what's up. There are two of us, so it's be a condo or townhouse. Now the foolish part, we thought we could find something that was at level (in terms of quality and finish) for 5-600k at was at least 11-1200sq ft.  



Short version. Oh, we saw places alright, but they were either in need of reno's or not in ideal locations (not close enough to walk to shopping, etc.). 



Doing more work on the realty sites, to get something we'd want to move to (so we wouldn't feel like we were going back to what we'd tolerate in our 20s. ) our budget got pushed to close to 900k. Nope. That was it.  Just couldn't see ourselves being house poor at this stage in our lives. 



Props to those who take the plunge, but boy, Vancouver is not attainable to balance quality of life (meaning being able to live and not be mired in debt) and a decent salaried job. 



Because of the beauty of the city (and we had killer weather), businesses can ""get away with"" paying sub-par salaries because people want to be there. Fine. But, what I did observe, with all the bravado of ""Hey, I live in Vancouver, look at me"", I did sense the stress of the costs/pay with those I chatted with, those that lived there and wondered how their kids would swing staying in the future. And, sorry, in general it is more costly (gas is .20 cents a litre higher, food was more, housing, etc.).



Not slagging, just being realistic. The best city to live in is the one where you can live comfortably. Having lived across the country (including a stint in Edmonton), I know what you get and that there is always give and take, but for us, it just didn't make sense. 



It is sad, that I ""can't go home again"", but the simple reality is, there is more to our lives than being cash strapped and money stressed all to say we live in Vancouver. :(



I'll continue to visit, continue to be texted pictures of blossoms in February by friends still in the city (when it's -30 here), but, in the end, we are staying put, with decent paying jobs with a mortgage that won't kill us if one of us loses our job. It's life.

  

So, don't read this long story as slagging your fair city (and my old one). Just story telling, and perhaps, providing some reality to others thinking of the same move. You have to weigh, in the end, what is valuable to you. And those glorious mountains, oceans, and mild winters just aren't enough. :)



Cheers!





TLDR - Wanted to move back. Housing costs and low pay put a bullet in it. Oh well.

What is your family and/or culture's belief about adult children living at home versus moving out ASAP?,"I've grown up with people from all sorts of cultures, and I myself am first generation from a family of immigrants.

My family's belief has been if you want to save up for a home, etc. you can live at home as an adult so long as you're doing something productive, and also school is paid for.  I've been really, really fortunate to have school paid for which allowed me to get my degree free of student loan payments.  

I've had other friends, mostly from immigrant families from India, China, Vietnam, places in Europe, etc. who share the same philosophy - the parents worked really hard so the kids can go to school.  They want their children to stay at home, save money, and advance themselves before moving out. Many also help their children purchase a property.

Then I have met people, mostly 3rd or more generation Canadian, who have told me that their parents kicked them out of the house at 18 or 19.  The benefit of course, is that they learned a lot of life experience by having to work, having to get student loans, having to earn every step of the way and really get the feeling of independence.

The downside, unfortunately, is a lot of them inevitably end up saddled with tremendous debt which limits their prosperity.  By 30, they will often have moved several times to various basement suites, have great stories, etc. but after paying rent, loans, and food they don't have a lot to put towards something more.

It's an interesting contrast - people I know who moved out right away after high school in Vancouver often are resigned to never owning a car, or a home, and accept renting indefinitely.  If you have student loans, are barely making ends meet, it's exceedingly difficult to have 100 grand in cash to put down on a piece of property.

Others have had to endure family life for several years longer, but then are in a position to buy their own home and build equity and get into the market.  My friend lived in his old Vancouver Special bedroom for years and years after high school, worked, saved a ridiculous amount of money and now has almost 200 grand saved up and is ready to enter the market.  I am damn impressed by his work ethic but it wouldn't have been possible without his family's help.

I've met some people whose families are from India, who are expected to marry and have kids, but when they do, they already have a house paid for to live in, often near the rest of the family.

Of course there's also the option that people move out and live alone but their parents are supporting them financially or paying their bills entirely.

It's interesting to see how different belief systems from different cultures shape people's ability to buy a place and to go to school, live debt free, etc.

So what was your family or culture's viewpoint on this?",Vancouver,2019-05-12 22:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/bnu6kx/what_is_your_family_andor_cultures_belief_about/,25

Lost my life savings,"Dear reddit,

I am a long time reddit lurker but I am posting this under a new account because I don't want my identity to be known. I wrote the bulk of this comment before Christmas day but never got the courage to post it. I was encouraged by [Louis Rossman's comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGz8z_TG_F8) from two days ago on WSB so here I am. I'm making this post to ask for advice on what to do after being hit with a financial catastrophe that I brought upon myself. This is not easy to write but I am going to try.

The short of it is that I'm in my late forties, and I recently lost all my life savings, all my retirement savings, all the education savings for my children. This is about $220k. Now it's been reduced to about $2000. I have been in shock for the last year and I just don't see a way forward.

To give some background, I will tell you that my name appears on the Ontario sunshine list because I make a little over $100k a year. Despite being on this list, I live in a very modest rented apartment, the cheapest I could find in my area close to work. This is the kind of apartment you would feel embarrassed to invite anyone to. We have no central air conditioning in the summer. The kitchen is probably 30 years old. It's just a very modest apartment. We own one car and we always buy used every 10-15 years because I always try to spend as little as possible and I only buy what I can afford. I've always avoided debt. I never carry a balance on a credit card. I churn credit cards to earn rewards that I can save. I've never taken a vacation outside of Ontario even though I've always dreamed of lying on a beautiful sandy beach in Mexico or Cuba. My wife and I are both immigrants and we don't have any familial wealth to look forward to. My wife doesn't work because her English isn't very good and she doesn't have employable skills, so we decided she would be a stay at home mom for our two children and save on childcare costs.

When my children were born I immediately opened RESP accounts for them and started depositing $2.5k a year to get the maximum amount of RESP grant. One of these accounts had $50k at one point before everything went to hell.

In 2009 I was sitting in a coffee shop with a friend who mentioned in passing a leveraged ETF that follows the price of oil, HOU.TO. At that time I only bought broad index funds and bond fonds to be on the safe side. This ETF looked attractive to me because the price of oil was volatile at that time and traded in a predictable range for a while (between $90 and $120).

I started cautiously putting only 10-20% of my money into it. I made money for a couple of years, buying low and selling high. Then buying HOD.TO (which bets that the price is too high) when the price of oil was high and selling it when the price was low.

Meanwhile every year house prices here climbed ever higher and my children got older, and the apartment got more crowded. My wife's nagging got more frequent as she saw people we know living in big houses with nice furniture. I kept telling her that this is a bubble and it will pop. If we sold our investments to use as a down payment on a house, surely we would buy just before the bubble popped and we would lose our savings. Of course, as with everything else, I was so so wrong.

In 2014, the price of oil crashed. I was holding HOD.TO at the time and so I made a few thousand dollars when I sold when the price reached about $80. Life in our home was becoming unbearable because of the house issue. The urgency I felt for the need to make money to buy a house was high. So while sitting at a coffee shop one day, I made the disastrous decision to go all in and put all our money in HOU.TO in anticipation that the price of oil will rise again back to at least $100 as it had done the past few years.

Of course this time, the price did not go back up. The price kept going down and down and my sense of security along with it. By February 2015 I saw the value of my portfolio plummet by more than 90%.  I tried to stay calm in the hope that the price would go up and I would at least get my savings back. Don't sell at the bottom they tell you. I didn't sell and I was trapped.

Over the next few years I avoided logging into my brokerage account because I could not face the loss. The price slowly went up over the years. By mid 2019 I had recovered a little. My 90% loss was now a 60% loss. The value of my account was now about $90k. I wish I had sold then. But I didn't.

In March 2020 the price of oil started to nosedive again because of covid. When it reached $20 I thought (being the f\*\*\*ing idiot I am) that it can't go any lower and this is my chance to buy as much as I can at the bottom and hopefully I can recover my losses when the crisis is over in a few weeks time. So I bought HOU.TO again with my last $10k of savings. Within a couple of weeks the price of oil would turn negative and the price of HOU would go down another 95%.  By April, my quarter of a million dollars in savings, my nest egg, my children's university money, were reduced to about $2k - a soul-destroying 99% loss.

There's more. Since all the money was in registered savings accounts, I cannot claim them as a loss on my tax return. How stupid can one be?? ~~I've contemplated ending it all but what would my family do without me?!~~ (04/03/2021: after reading all your comments below I apologize for the previous sentence. It is ridiculous and unnecessary. I realize that now.)

I did not lose my job during the pandemic. I do not have debt. I do have a defined-benefits pension plan. But I am still renting because I missed my chance to buy a house. I wish I used the money as a down payment instead of investing. I used to read Garth Turner's blog years ago and it convinced me that the housing bubble pop was just around the corner, that I would be a fool to buy a house just before it popped. But it turned out I was the biggest fool of all.

Now I'm in my late 40s. I know that I have lost the game. I don't have enough time to save for retirement or buy a house. I will have to rent forever. I feel desperate. My marriage is falling apart. I look at successful people and then I look at myself with disgust for losing everything. I did it to myself.

As a desperate effort, I am posting this here as I am contemplating my miserable future, just in case someone has a good suggestion for me to follow. Maybe someone can recommend someone like a financial planner or something who can make a plan for me to recover from this disaster. I have lost all faith in my ability to make good financial decisions.

Excuse the incoherence of this lengthy post. It was hard to write and I wrote it over several weeks because it is very painful to face the reality of what I did. While I know it's a long shot that this post will result in anything to help me, maybe at least it will serve as a cautionary tale and save someone from ending up in my shoes.

I'm going to stop now. Please no mean replies. I fully realize how stupid I am and do not need it rubbed in my face.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 03/03/2021:**

Thank you everyone for your kind replies, comments, advice and PMs. I posted my comment 24 hours ago and logged in now, and your responses are overwhelming. I will go through them slowly but surely. I find it hard to spend more than a short time a day thinking about this because it brings me such anxiety and ruins my mood for the rest of the day.

For those who think that I will gamble again, I am now even hesitant to buy a broad index ETF. All the money I saved in the past year is sitting in cash until I have some kind of plan, which is why I posted my story, to get some input and feedback. I do feel tempted sometimes to buy a little Dogecoin or something but I won't spend more than $100 on such a thing. I have learned my lesson. Funny story: I bought one bitcoin for $20 in 2013 that I sold a few months later for $120 and thought that I made a good profit!

But what I have read so far and your personal experiences (thank you so much for sharing) make me feel hopeful that there is a way to recover, I just have to find it. I will post more questions as I go through your comments. I do have these questions though for now:

1. How do I go about finding a financial advisor that will give good advice and won't cost me hundreds of dollars more?
2. Is there any way to claim losses in RRSP, RESP or TFSA in my tax return? I didn't sell yet, that's another decision that I have to make.
3. Can you recommend a good mix of index ETFs to put future savings into?

**Again, thank you for all the love and kindness, and for taking the time to reply. I am truly grateful.**

\* I added this update as an edit to my original post. Is this the right way? Or should I have commented on my original post?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 04/03/2021:**

I want to thank everyone who took the time to write a reply. My perspective is changing since reading all the comments here. Today was actually a good day where I didn't feel awful about this. I feel like a heavy weight is lifting. Thank you. I am still reading all the replies and processing. If I don't reply to your post in person and thank you, please know that I am grateful to each and everyone of you.

I also wanted to clear some things up regarding my wife:

1. I did try to involve her in the financial decisions but investing is not something she knows much about, so it was left to me to take care of.  I did tell her what happened a few months ago. She was devastated at first when she realized her dreams were wrecked, but over the last few months she has adjusted her expectations and she is supportive and understanding now.
2. Also, to be fair, she did try to find work. 4 years ago she started taking courses in a discipline that she's good at and she studied hard and earned a couple of certificates. Then she went to a couple of interviews but because she was not fluent it did not work out. Then covid happened and the chances of her finding work evaporated as someone who hasn't worked for years and has no Canadian work experience.

Something is rotten in the GTA (and Canadian) real estate market and it isn't going to change,"...obviously.

My family spent the last 6 months trying to buy a detached home in Durham. I'll spare you the nightmarish details of 30 offer houses, near tear downs going for 170k over asking, prices going up 50k week over week, etc. but needless to say we've decided to call it quits for now. It was just that awful.

In the entire ordeal, one thing stood out more than anything else: a large proportion of buyers currently are investors, not people looking for a primary residence. Shockingly, we don't even actually have stats on the number of investors in the market as Stats Can (as far as I know) [doesn't gather this information.](https://chra-achru.ca/examining-the-dynamics-of-canadas-housing-tenure-system-implications-for-a-national-housing-strategy/)

The presence of investors in and of itself is not horrible, of course - someone has to provide rental properties. But when there is so much capital in the market (looking at you all time low interest rates) and so little inventory, the end result is that many people who are simply looking for a place to live are getting squeezed out.

A commenter on here recently suggested a great lever that the government could use to tamp down on this trend: **up the capital gains tax on non-primary residence sales.**

Thinking this was a great idea, I decided to do a bit more digging, and remembered something I had read a while back (originally posted by [fractx](https://www.reddit.com/user/fractx)) that took away all my enthusiasm:

The Canadian housing market is too big to fail.

1. **Real estate (and associated the construction sectors) are now the #1 contributor to GDP** at 15% of Canada's GDP. Over time the economy has morphed to depend on housing as our primary driver of growth. This has been even further exacerbated by COVID and the collapse in the Alberta oil sector. The Canadian economy is dangerously under-diversified with slow decade over decade declines in manufacturing, mining, etc. This is the primary reason why no politician would dare hurt the real estate or associated construction sectors currently - we have barely anything else propping up our country.
2. **A housing collapse would destroy the banking system,** which is built on collateral assets such as housing. [In Canada's largest bank's October 2020 credit risk analysis (see pg. 68), residential mortgages and HELOCs made up by far the most significant portion of all outstanding credit](https://www.rbc.com/investor-relations/_assets-custom/pdf/ar_2020_e.pdf). If home prices crater and homeowners are underwater, all Canadian banks would end up with negative equity (liabilities > assets) and everyone would stop lending to each other. Bankruptcies and unemployment would soar. It's ugly. The government would then have to spend massively more to bail out banks in addition to reviving a collapsed economy. That's what happened in 2008 before they started flooding the market with money to prop up banks in the US.
3. **Canadians own housing** and they don't want to see price come down. The majority of Canadian households in desirable cities are homeowners, and have their nest eggs invested in housing. Falling home prices sets everyone back from retirement, and they carry that displeasure to the polls during elections.
4. **Homeowners feel wealthier** when home prices go up, they go spend money in retail, food services, personal services, technology, etc. Those sectors then hire more people, and they increase their spending and the cycle continues. If the music stops, renters are often the first to lose their jobs.
5. **Local policies kowtowing to voters** have resorted to perverted NIMBY policies to slow the supply of new homes. Majority of City of Vancouver's land mass is zoned low density to maintain neighborhood characteristics. Voters go up in arms to protest whenever this zoning status is threatened. Vancouver city councillors voted in May to reduce building permits to supply new homes in Vancouver by half [source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-not-even-the-pandemic-slowed-vancouver-real-estate/).

This is why short of serious incompetence and negligence, no political will is ever strong enough to shake Canadian housing market. Real estate is not a strictly free market because of the emotional, social, economic, and political upheaval its unravel could cause. **This is also why every recession will see wealth inequality widen.**

The first thing the Canadian government did during COVID-19 was to save the housing market. Low interest rates, reduced stress testing thresholds, deferrals, giving homeowners money to pay mortgages, etc.

It's never going to stop until the threat to housing is removed.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-02-16 23:51:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/llfv79/something_is_rotten_in_the_gta_and_canadian_real/,1624
"Quality of life has materially gone down in Canada over the past half century, a collection of datapoints","With an election coming up the parties ignoring this issue is irrefutable proof they care about their own thirst for power more than the long term health of the country. It’s no wonder with “leaders” like these that living standards have collapsed. They will eventually have to atone, of that there is no doubt. 

EDIT: Threat got locked. There's a crosspost in canadahousing with comments open if people would like to continue the discussion. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/owdqel/quality\_of\_life\_has\_materially\_gone\_down\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadahousing/comments/owdqel/quality_of_life_has_materially_gone_down_in/)

  
Hello, again. I'm the one who made the post a couple days ago about median male income being down in Canada

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/otwiuf/the\_average\_male\_income\_in\_canada\_has\_gone\_down/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/otwiuf/the_average_male_income_in_canada_has_gone_down/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I was surprised by the amount of cope in the thread arguing ways our lives have gotten better. I've decided to compile in one post some resources outlining how that's not the case.

First, overall median income is still down, though mostly flat since 1976.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.3&pickMembers%5B2%5D=3.1&pickMembers%5B3%5D=4.3&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1976&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2019&referencePeriods=19760101%2C20190101](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.3&pickMembers%5B2%5D=3.1&pickMembers%5B3%5D=4.3&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1976&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2019&referencePeriods=19760101%2C20190101)

Second, although people are broadly aware of the meme ""stagnant wages"", it's apparent to me that most people don't realize how much of a calamity this is. Until the 1970s living standards had been steadily increasing across the West. For that to change is a massive reversal.

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-Builders-Day-Wages-from-1200-to-2000\_fig1\_247816806](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-Builders-Day-Wages-from-1200-to-2000_fig1_247816806)

In the 25 years before 1976 real wages increased 2.5x in Canada.

[http://ccsd.ca/factsheets/fs\_avgin.html](http://ccsd.ca/factsheets/fs_avgin.html)

Third, this has been at the same time as average education has skyrocketed. For overall wages to stay flat as you need more and more education to achieve that outcome is a decrease in your quality of life.

[https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/esdc-edsc/migration/images/eng/standards\_equity/eq/pubs\_eq/eedr/2011/images/fig3.jpg](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/esdc-edsc/migration/images/eng/standards_equity/eq/pubs_eq/eedr/2011/images/fig3.jpg)

Fourth, the cost of education has massively increased in real terms. This is on top of the fact you need more of it just to stand still.

[https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/sites/ca.canadian-index-wellbeing/files/uploads/images/image011.png](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/sites/ca.canadian-index-wellbeing/files/uploads/images/image011.png)

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-004-x/2006001/chrt/cost.gif](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-004-x/2006001/chrt/cost.gif)

Fifth, the quality of jobs has gone down. For instance, your boss always expects to reach you on e-mail now. The % of people in contract work has skyrocketed.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-631-x/2018001/c-g20-eng.png](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-631-x/2018001/c-g20-eng.png)

Sixth, pensions have faded away. Not only do fewer overall people have a pension, but the % of those with a defined-benefit plan is down too.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14120/c-g/c-g02-eng.gif](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14120/c-g/c-g02-eng.gif)

Finally I come to housing. The issue's been hammered to death so I won't obsess over the figures only add a few lesser-discussed points. Home ownership is basically not included in CPI. As a result, incomes staying flat while housing costs skyrocket is a disaster for living standards. Rents have gone up well above inflation as well, it's not like if you rent you've been unaffected.

Because home prices have skyrocketed more and more people are living with their parents. That's a very real decline in your living standards vs your grandparents.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2016001/article/14639-eng.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2016001/article/14639-eng.htm)

Commute times have also gone up, that's another very real decrease in your quality of life due to increased cost of housing.

[https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/what-we-do/domains-and-indicators/mean-workday-commute-time-individuals-working-pay](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/what-we-do/domains-and-indicators/mean-workday-commute-time-individuals-working-pay)

Finally, the argument that mortgage payments haven't changed that much doesn't hold water. Interest rates were so high because inflation was so high, they're directly related. A mortgage is defined by having a flat payment in nominal terms for all 25-30 years. As a result, the higher inflation means the real payment you have to make decreases remarkably quickly if there's high inflation. You may have a similar payment to start, but in real terms a few years out the payment is much lower.

All of this combined means we've seen a drastic decline in the quality of our lives for a given level of education/occupation. That isn't typical on a post-industrial revolution time frame. The graph I gave of 1,000 years of UK data was for the same job.

Doing more of the same would be insane. If you've benefited you should feel guilty. If you've had influence on policy you should be ashamed. The other guy being worse doesn't cut it.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-08-01 16:57:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ovuoks/quality_of_life_has_materially_gone_down_in/,2532
My journey to $1M RRSP started 25 years ago,"I see lots of people on here just starting out with their retirement savings. I thought it might be interesting to see a real-life example of one person's retirement savings journey. I don't consider myself typical, because I do make quite a bit compared to the Canadian average, but I want to show what can happen with slow and steady investing over a long time period. I'm not retired yet, but my RRSP recently broke through $1 million dollars (yaay!) after 25 years of RRSP investing and I wanted to share this. I'm not a stockbroker and don't pretend to have some magical insights into the market other than buy low-cost broad-market ETFs. I've been through 6 corrections/crashes from the dot-com bubble through COVID. I fully acknowledge that I'm in a very advantageous position due to a well-paying IT job and being able to get into the housing market long before the huge run-up in prices (my first home cost me $135,000) so my experience won't likely translate to today's reality.

For a bit of context for those who asked, I'm nearly 50 years old (will turn on 420!) with a wife and child. I own a house just outside the GTA in Ontario. Lived in Ontario all my life.

When I did my taxes (on paper!) in the spring of 1996, I was left with a staggering tax bill of something like $700. As a young 20-something dude taking home $1800 a month with car payments/rent/food/entertainment eating up most of that, I certainly didn't have $700 lying around. Somehow, I learned about some too-good-to-be-true saving strategy that would reduce my tax bill to zero. All I had to do was take out a loan to myself for $1095 and deposit that amount into this fancy account called an RRSP. All I had to do was pay off the loan over the next year. Making 12 monthly payments of $87.53 (to myself!!!) at 7% interest was much more palatable than coming up with $700 to give to the tax man. SIGN. ME. UP.  I opened up a self-directed RRSP account with my bank at CIBC. This inadvertently started my retirement savings journey that has recently seen it hit the magical $1 million mark after just a hair over 25 years.

I've learned a lot over the years. After I paid off my initial RRSP loan, I realized that it would be better to make automatic regular contributions instead of taking out a loan every year, at which point some of my hard-earned money would go to the bank in the form of interest. I started with $125 a month put into what I now know are high-cost mutual funds. I thought taking that money out of my limited budget would hurt, but I really didn't notice it after the first few months. I adjusted my spending patterns without any real difficulty.

The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 1999 didn't hit my portfolio hard, but my RRSP didn't grow for an entire year, even with regular contributions which had grown to $600/month thanks to a new high-paying IT consulting gig that grossed me $100K+/year for a few really good years. After that gig ended, I took a salaried IT consulting job for $65K/year. That company had an RRSP-matching program, which I took full advantage of. My RRSP value grew slowly, but steadily. For a while, I would jump from one under-performing mutual fund to the latest ""hot"" high-fee mutual fund only to repeat the same pattern every year or so. My returns were never stellar as a result of the drag incurred by the high MERs, even as I transitioned from boutique mutual funds to index mutual funds.

In 2008, I learned about low-cost ETFs and the Couch Potato investing strategy. I opened an account with QTrad and switched all my mutual funds from CIBC Investors Edge to Vanguard/iShares just in time for the 2008 crash. Luckily, I paid off the mortgage on my first home not long after the crash, and I plowed the majority of my old mortgage payment into my RRSP until we moved into a bigger home in 2012 just after our child was born. My RRSP contributions dropped dramatically due to my wife taking an extended maternity leave, but my RRSP grew steadily.  After my wife went back to work in 2014, I increased my contributions again and kept increasing along with my salary, which topped out at $135K/year in early 2015.

In 2015, I took a new job paying a fair bit more than my old job and started whittling away at my expanding RRSP contribution room. Along with regular contributions, I would throw as much as possible from my emergency fund into my RRSP every spring to maximize my tax return which I would use to replenish my emergency fund. This year, I finally used up all my available RRSP contribution room. Thanks to the increasingly nutty stock market, my RRSP recently broke through the $1M barrier.

My current RRSP breakdown looks like this:

# CDN RRSP

|XGRO|26.4%|
|:-|:-|
|VCE|10.8%|
|Cash|2.7%|

# USD RRSP

|VEA|20.4%|
|:-|:-|
|VWO|3.5%|
|VTI|35.8%|
|Cash|0.3%|

Thanks to a helpful Redditor that I can no longer find, I looked up my total RRSP contributions from 1996 to today, and it totals $384,530.  The rest are capital gains and dividends.

It feels like the current stock market run-up is unsustainable, so I've got some cash sitting in a money market fund waiting for a correction. This is outside my normal monthly contributions, which goes straight to XGRO via PAC. My investing strategy is buy broad market ETFs and HOLD. I don't pretend to know what's coming next, which I guess I contradict by holding some cash for a presumably eventual correction. I just hate missing out on buying opportunities. On the other hand, I've been proven wrong more often than right, so maybe I should just put it to work in XGRO.

I'm still 10-15 years away from retirement, so I don't feel I need to start adjusting my strategy yet. Moving forward, I plan on maxing out my RRSP every year and adding as much as I can to my TFSA (which has been pretty much ignored in favour of RRSP), while paying down the mortgage over the next 10 years. With a bit of luck, I should have a very comfortable retirement that allows my wife and I to travel and have lots of fun until we can't do it anymore.

Even though past performance isn't an indicator of future performance, I hope that this peek into some rando's retirement strategy over 25 years gives people some hope for a nice chunk of retirement money at some distant point.  Believe me, even though 25 years seems like a long time, it really isn't. Keep plugging away.

"Unable to sell house to break even, any help would be appreciated.","Sorry if this is horribly formatted, I'm not a redditor. 

My wife and I bought 6 months ago at the height of the housing market it seems now. We bought hours away from work (Toronto) as we both were working from home. We thought WAH would be permanent and we were both afraid of missing out on buying if we didn't pull the trigger. Wife is being called back to work full time. I've been given notice that we're going back part time come September. 

We listed our house a bit over two weeks ago, no offer has come in that we break even on let alone profit. Our realtor has told us the market is cooling and that it would be a surprise if we got what we were asking for. We've gotten a couple of offers, none of which are asking price.

We're at a loss. My wife is looking for work locally but due to the nature of her work she is unlikely to find equivalent in pay or opportunity. She also doesn't want to leave her employer, she has great upward mobility and seniority there. I don't personally mind commuting part time but she's livid about the situation and refuses to live here now. 

My friends keep telling me that there is no such thing as a Canadian market cooling and to just wait it out until it sells. 

If we listed for rent I think we wouldn't be making a profit.

Neighbour didn't accept only offer and no other offers came in.,"In the last week my neighbours house had tons of people coming to view the property. Offer day came and only one person submitted an offer but he thought it was a low ball offer as it was less than a house that went for on our street that was less renovated than his. He's refusing to list at a lower price but has already purchased his next property.

Just read this blog post by Remax and it's quite timely: [https://blog.remax.ca/has-the-canadian-real-estate-market-peaked/](https://blog.remax.ca/has-the-canadian-real-estate-market-peaked/)

For all the sellers out there, I think we need to start being more realistic about expectations or we're going to miss out on a sale and cause some hurt down the line particularly if you've already committed to a second property.

EDIT: A lot of people are not reading the article I posted. This is not anecdotal, realtors are having clients not accept the offers they're getting because others in their neighbourhood sold for more (previously) when the current market is different/is starting to cool. I'm a home owner, I'm thinking about my next move and just want to make an informed decision. This is the biggest purchase of your lives. But it's clear from a lot of other home owners in this sub they just want to deceive and FOMO prices. It's really unfortunate for a place that's supposed to be about personal finance.

* One in five Canadians said it is likely that they will have to obtain food or meals from a community organization in the next six months.
* Younger Canadians are more likely than older Canadians to be very concerned about their ability to afford housing or rent.
* To deal with rising prices, half of Canadians said they have sought out sales and promotions in the past six months. Meanwhile, 47% have found themselves purchasing cheaper alternatives, brands or items, and 45% have delayed making a purchase in response to rising prices.

How can I *actually* afford a kid?,"Husband (27M) and I (25F) want to start trying for kids soon as I have a condition that causes infertility and my odds get slimmer as I get older. Combined after-tax HHI of $6000/mos. Here are our monthly expenses:

- Mortgage: $2000/mos ($350k left at 4.89%), rural town near Ottawa

- Property taxes: $200/mos

- Car payment: $400/mos ($24k left at 6% — we dropped down to one car [bought a Corolla] after each of our beaters died) 

- Car insurance + home insurance: $250/mos

- Hydro: $70 to $105/mos

- Gas (house is propane): $100/mos

No water bill as we have a well

- Groceries: $300/mos (I make staples like bread, jam, kimchi, etc., at home and price match my groceries) 

- Takeout: $150/mos

- Entertainment (Spotify, Funimation): $30/mos

- Phones (both): $70/mos

- Internet: $105/mos (Bell Fibe is the only option on our street) 

Doesn’t include the two camping trips we take a year, which I estimate cost about $2k all in. 

We have about $10k in savings, nothing invested. Husband has student loan with $18k left. No credit card debt or LOC. 

If I went on mat leave, I’d be getting a max of about $600/week — just enough to cover the mortgage and property taxes. I am the breadwinner, but my salary alone ($3600/mos after tax) is not enough to cover our base expenses plus the cost of diapers and potentially formula. Husband makes roughly $2400/mos, but he’s a tradesman so hours can be lighter in Feb/March. With a combined pre tax income over $100k, we’d get almost nothing in CCB. 

I hear people say “kids don’t need fancy, just cut out the entertainment or dining out and go on fewer vacations and you’ll be fine.” But basic expenses on our little 700sq ft bungalow eat up one of our incomes alone, and renting even in crap towns 1hr + out of the city like Smiths Falls or South Mountain costs well over $1400/mos + utilities for a small 2bdr flat. We bought the literal cheapest house in town that didn’t have a roof about to cave in or a wood foundation. 

Can anyone see where I can cut back to afford a kid — daycare, formula, diapers, meds?

Canadian Housing Market Will Stay Down ‘For Years’ Due To Lower Immigration,"Article [here](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/housing-market-canada_ca_5eac2ed3c5b65156135c8434).

But an economist at U.K.-based Capital Economics says Canada’s house prices are set to fall, and stay down “for years” because the country can expect a decline in immigration levels.

“Demand for housing has become extremely reliant on immigration,” Stephen Brown wrote in a client note this week. 

If immigration does fall, the housing market will be the hardest hit part of the economy, he said. 

“Investors have based their (house or condo) purchases on the assumption that immigration will keep rents growing strongly. That will be a questionable assumption even if restrictions on travel are soon lifted.”

Real-time data from rental listings sites suggests that Toronto rents have already fallen 3 to 5 per cent since the crisis began, which is “pretty big for a month,” Brown said.

"How I keep my expenses under $16k/yr in Vancouver, BC, Canada - Savings tips from BigCheapass","Hey folks,

Life can be pretty expensive these days especially in a HCOL area like Metro Vancouver, that's why I wanted to share things I've done to minimize my expenses and maximize savings. I know many will consider at least some of these tips extreme, but if you can find even one new way to save money it'll have been worth me writing this!

Before I start I want to address the inevitable;

**You don't live in Vancouver.** This post was meant to be understandable to those outside of the lower mainland. I live roughly 15 km from the Vancouver proper limits. If I could change the title I would make it Vancouver (Metro). I'm sure no one outside of BC knows where ""North Delta / Surrey"" is.

**But why are you making yourself miserable?** I'm not, my partner and I are happy living minimalist lifestyles. We still do a lot of the same things others do, just spend less money doing it. We go on international vacations (to less expensive places), we go hiking, we play video games, we eat out (with coupons or promos), etc.

**Why do you spend so little / save so much?** FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early). The goal is to retire as early as possible (in my 30s) and live off investments. Once retired I can pursue other things I am more passionate about without the worry of covering my bills.

**It's only possible to live this cheap when you own;** Rent in units equivalent to mine in my area / building go for roughly 1500-1600, so my total monthly would actually be slightly lower if I rented.

**It's only possible to live this cheap when you have a partner;** Absolutely. Having a partner saves a lot. You would also have similar results with a roommate which I strongly recommend in any HCOL city such as Vancouver. We do keep our personal finances fully separate except for shared expenses, that's why I am discussing ""my expenses"" and not ""our expenses"".

# Housing - $878

Total housing expenses are $1,685 - of which my partner pays $807 - Note that I live outside Vancouver proper. From my home to Broadway City Hall  it would take 1 hour by transit and 30 minutes by car (no traffic) probably closer to 45m to an hour with traffic. Neither of us work downtown so this isn't an issue.

**Mortgage - $1,120**

I purchased the condo for 320k in 2017, it is currently assessed at 350k. I renewed last year when rates were low at 1.69% fixed 3 year (This was a mistake, should have done variable). Some tips here; **Find a mortgage broker** when shopping for mortgages, they can sometimes help you find better rates and conditions and may add value if your financial situation is complicated. Also check around for what lenders are offering directly, **some lenders don't work through brokers**. Also check out **online brokers** like [https://intellimortgage.com/](https://intellimortgage.com/) this may be a good option for some.

**Strata / Condo fees - $310**

When buying a place make sure to r**eview the minutes, check contingency fund, depreciation report**, etc. A low strata is not always ""cheaper"" in the long run if you are getting constant assessments. Likewise, a poorly managed strata will probably still come with additional costs even if the strata is high. If you don't have much use for amenities, consider places that don't have them, it will typically be cheaper.

**Property Tax - $90**

Depending on your situation **you may be eligible for grants** to reduce property tax owed. Some possible grants exist for seniors, disability, principal residence, etc. Without my principal residence grant my monthly property tax would be an extra $47.50. You can also appeal property value assessments if you believe your property was valued too high, if successful this would reduce your property tax.

**Home Insurance - $50**

Not much to say here, just shop around.

**Internet (300 Mbps down / 15 Mbps up) - $55**

Canadian internet is some of the most expensive in the world but there are ways to save;

* Check if there are affordable local providers, Vancouver has ""Novus"" as an example.
* Check for affordable resellers, Teksavvy, lightspeed, etc.
* Negotiate with the big boys. I'm currently with Shaw which is one of the big providers on a 2 year contract for 55$/month.

Towards the end of a contract providers will typical start pushing you to confirm renewal, you will want to start negotiating here as the initial price offers are often poor. You can also try to call ""customer loyalty / customer retention"" to get a better offer. I had 3 or 4 calls with Shaw before I got the 55$ offer. You can also play the game of chicken and initiate the switch to another provider, they all communicate with each other through their own channels and your current provider may offer you a last minute ""please stay with us"" deal.

**Electricity - $60**

This is a bit higher than normal as my partner and I each have a crypto miner running for some extra money. Some typical advice here; If you have a **gas fireplace** in a place where gas is really cheap, use it instead of conventional heating. I haven't touched my baseboard heaters since I've moved in and gas is included in my strata. Don't blast the AC if you don't need to, for small temperature changes just add / remove clothing. Get efficient appliances, don't leave stuff on you aren't using, etc. Also check for **rebates** and **discounts** from your energy provider! There are often incentives available for energy efficient upgrades.

# Other Expenses - $434

Total other expenses are $677 - Netflix ($16), Car insurance ($140), Gas ($50), and Groceries ($280) are split 50/50 with my partner, therefore $434.

**Groceries - $140**

For two adults we spend about $280/month which we divide 50/50. This also includes cleaning products, etc.

* **Meal prep & batch cooking**. Cooking a big batch of healthy food is surprisingly cheap. If you are busy get a slow cooker and look up slow cooker recipes, it's super easy, affordable, and convenient. If you don't want the same thing every night have multiple batches on the go, freeze and alternate. Some really cheap and delicious dishes we make; Spaghetti, Chili, Carbonara, Goulash, Roasts, Rice & Beans (with bacon), Lasagna, (a few things we made up and don't have a name for), etc.
* Don't shop for stuff you need *right now*, prices fluctuate a lot and **it's better to be stocked on heavily variable items when you see a sale. Meat** is the biggest culprit here. When I see a pork tenderloin sale (<7$/kg) I stock up big time. Then over the next several months whenever I need a meat for a dish I just take one out of the freezer a few days ahead, put in the fridge, then cook. (Don't defrost too fast or it makes the meat gross) We eat lot's of steaks, fish, ribs, pork loins, etc. And almost never pay more than 7$/kg. (We shop at superstore)
* Look at **$/weight** not **$/item**. I always hear people saying they only paid 9$ or whatever for a steak, then I look and it's like this tiny little nugget for $45/kg. Don't do this.
* For **produce** it helps to look around and **be flexible**. We alternate veggies based on the prices. Some weeks carrots are cheap. Some weeks Zucchini are cheap. If nothing is cheap we just buy assorted frozen which is 2$/kg at superstore. Also for produce sometimes **bulk bags can be cheaper than 1 or 2 individual items**, often we only need 3 large onions, will see the price is 2$/lb, then see a bag of onions is like 3$. Literally cheaper to buy an entire bag than a couple onions.
* Also **buy non branded stuff**. 90% of the time the quality difference is negligible.
* Use **point programs** / look at flyers. Don't go out of your way to buy things that give points but do make sure to collect and use the ones you get from your typical spending.
* Get a good **cash back** credit card. Typically you can get a fairly significant % cash back on groceries (3%+).
* We also don't buy any organic, vegan, etc. items.

**Gas - $25**

We spend $50 on gas split 50/50. **I am currently work from home**, most of our gas costs right now are going to hikes, short road trips on weekends, getting groceries, etc. Gas is another good candidate for **cash back** credit cards, and loyalty cards. Usually you can get 3% back + here fairly easily. Also **don't buy premium gas** if you don't need it; [https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/11/16/why-premium-gas-is-a-waste-of-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/11/16/why-premium-gas-is-a-waste-of-money.html)While I was working in office full time gas costs were \~$120/month.

**Auto Insurance - $70**

We spend $140 on insurance and split 50/50. Insurance is typically very expensive in the lower mainland but we **drive a really cheap car and only have third party liability**. If my car were to explode tomorrow worst case scenario I am out of pocket $2,000, not a big deal and not worth spending more on comprehensive coverage. In BC you can only get liability insurance from one source, but in places where you can shop around, make sure to do so. Also consider getting **higher deductibles** to reduce your premiums. Check if it is cheaper to pay for a year upfront vs monthly payments.

**Clothes - $4 (Averaged monthly over last 4 or so years)**

I put $4 here because the only thing I've bought in the last year has been hiking shoes for $48. In previous years I've spent similar amounts. Buy mid range quality clothes and you won't need to buy more for a long time. 5 years ago I bought some gently used dress shirts for $10 each and they are still perfect condition today. My jeans from years ago are all still in good condition. My ""walmart"" tshirts / socks, etc. are still fine.

**Haircuts - $0**

Several years back I got a grooming kit which I've loved using ever since. Not only is it free to cut my own hair I also can do it whenever I want from my own home. I'll admit the first time I cut my own hair I looked like a toothbrush but it get's easier and I do a pretty good job now. (girlfriend approves)

**Health / Dental / Etc - $0**

My partner and I have coordination of benefits with our works and I elected for a health spending account instead of additional coverage. Most things are fully covered by our collective plans, everything else is covered by the health spending account. Without coverage I would have spent around $500 in the last year and typically around $200 annually.

**Eating Out - $20**

We typically eat out a few times per month. We each have a bunch of food apps on our phone and usually at any given time at least one promo will be available. Some favorites are the $2 big macs during hockey season, Ubereats promos (then we pickup anyway to save on delivery), $5 meal combo at BK, etc. We very rarely eat out at proper restaurants as we don't find it worth the price (only special occasions).

**Mobile Phone - $17**

Typically the big cell providers are not worth using here. I have a Freedom Mobile plan which has 100 minutes talk, unlimited text, and no charge for data overages (effectively unlimited 3g data). Also check out Public Mobile, Zoomer, etc. Do the math on whether or not it is worth to buy a phone yourself, typically the cheapest plans are only available for BYOP, I bought my current phone upfront (A50) for \~ $250. Sometimes you can also get package deals with your internet provider, not always cheaper though.

**Netflix - $8**

We pay 16$ here split 50/50. Debating on if this is even worth it anymore as many shows get snatched up by other services. I've heard some folks recommend using a VPN to be able to watch Netflix for other countries but typically the free ones are blocked by Netflix.

**Misc & Entertainment - $150**

This is my fun money / unexpected expenses. Usually this goes towards road trips, or saved up for vacations. We prefer going to cheaper places as it's much easier to get the ""full"" experience without breaking the bank. In many countries you can get a lovely top notch restaurant meal for <$5 and accommodations for many times less than you would in Canada. We are still young but look forward to seeing much of the world while staying on a budget. Last year the budget went towards a gaming PC since no travel (covid).

**Banking / Investing fees - $0**

There is no reason to be loyal to financial institutions which charge exorbitant banking fees anymore. I currently do my every day banking with EQ Bank (online only bank) and I have Tangerine for if I ever need to use a debit or atm. Neither have any typical day-to-day fees or account balance minimums.

# Total Spending - C$1,312 ($15,744 / year)

If I could highlight the three biggest contributors to being able to keep expenses this low;

* Sharing expenses with a partner / roommate
* Living outside the city core
* Keeping a budget, tracking expenses, and being diligent

# Extra Savings / Income Supplements / Free Money - ($3,150)

Some things I did to get a little extra cash on top of my day job in the last year. Basically free money. Some / most of these may not be applicable but just some ideas;

* $30 (per month) - Rent out a parking space; If you own a condo or home you may have extra parking space that can be rented out for some extra cash. My condo came with 2 spots, I rent one out for $30/month.
* $180 (per month) - Crypto mining. If you are a PC gamer like me you probably already have the hardware needed to mine in your downtime. With my 5700 XT at current mine rates and prices ($4,200 CAD -> 1 ETH) I am getting about $180 per month. I can convert this to gift cards for stuff like amazon purchases or groceries using services like Bidali or convert it to CAD and etransfer it to myself with services like shakepay.
* $200 (this year) Credit card promos - I'm not that into this but you can make / save a lot of money using promo offers, check out [https://www.reddit.com/r/churningcanada/](https://www.reddit.com/r/churningcanada/). This year I got $50 for free signing up for the amazon card and $150 for 1k of spend with the Tangerine card.
* $280 (this year) Bank promo offers / referral; If you want to game this you probably can but I don't really bother, this is just what I got for signing up and setting payroll to Tangerine ($200), referring my partner to Tangerine ($50) and referring my partner to EQ bank ($30). Not going to plug but feel free to DM if you want referral code for free money on signup.
* \~$100 (this year) Cash Bank; I don't really spend much so this isn't very high. Check out which cards are best for you; [https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/best-cash-back-credit-cards-in-canada/](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/best-cash-back-credit-cards-in-canada/). Personally I use Rogers World Elite and Tangerine World which are both no annual fee cards.
* \~$50 (this year) High Interest Savings Account; I use EQ Bank as my daily banking, interest is calculated daily, the time between me receiving my pay cheque and paying my bills / sending to investment account I earn interest. This also doubles as an emergency fund account if needed. [https://www.highinterestsavings.ca/chart/](https://www.highinterestsavings.ca/chart/) EQ Bank has consistently had some of the highest rates here and has generally good service, would recommend.

Are Canadians too reliant on home equity as a “retirement plan”? And ROI on your house?,"I remember reading the Wealthy Barber Returns and him saying to not depend on home equity as a retirement fund. 

Many people plan on downsizing their house during retirement and using the excess money to fund their retirement, but how many people actually downsize? 

Unless you have a $1MM house and downsize to a $300,000 house, is it even really worth it? 

Also, people always look at how much their property value has increased. Let’s say you purchased a house at $300,000 and it tripled in price to $900,000 30 years later when you want to sell it. That’s only an annualized ROI of 3.73%,  which is pretty lousy compared to the averaged annual return of the S&P 500 (10-11%). And that doesn’t even account for the interest you paid on your mortgage.

What are your guys thoughts?

EDIT: Not trying to do a super in depth analysis here, I was more so trying to point out that a $600,000 appreciation in home price sounds like a lot, but spread over the ownership period (say 30 years) is not as high as you would think. I know areas like GTA and Vancouver would have a higher appreciation but for a lot of places in Canada I feel like this is realistic (maybe even worse in more undesirable locations).",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-03-23 19:42:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mbmyt2/are_canadians_too_reliant_on_home_equity_as_a/,587
My friend reads this subreddit a lot and now hates home owners - want to get better understanding of his position,"Context:

Early 30s parent in Toronto here. I caught up with few friends over virtual meeting past weekend. We were in same university program (finance) so our situation is similar - married (or was going to get married this summer), own a property in Toronto, doing well in career (160k+ household income). Then there is C.

C is single and still lives with in the same room at his parent's house that he had since grade 5. He should be on similar salary range as us (at least 80k). He is frugal and doesn't spend money on frivolous things, spends a lot of his spare time on stocks and memes. He has been telling us for years that housing market cannot be sustained and bubble is going to pop any minute. When we went into lock down in early March, he told us that he had 100k cash ready and was hoping to buy a detached house south of Bloor for 500k. I think C is upset there wasn't a crash like he anticipated.

C was going off about how ""If you go on Reddit onto personal finance Canada and Toronto subreddit, majority opinion is that Canadian economy will collapse if the government keeps prioritizing needs of land owner class over common people"" and ""Property owners in Toronto are just as bad as factory owners in 19th century because they are profiting from blood of others"". When one of our friends pointed out that, while mortgage deferral does help home owners, there was also CERB which would have helped C's stock portfolio, he responded ""I have to think and make critical decisions to make money from stocks, any retard can make money from house by just holding onto it and praying to Trudeau"".

Now C has always been somewhat of a pessimist but we were always friends and could see eye-to-eye on most subjects. I understand his frustration with Toronto housing price but it's not like any of us in the friend circle are leveraged to eyeballs with 3 rental units. We all have well paying jobs, our spouses have well paying jobs, some of us got help from parents, others didn't. Most of us bought a pre-construction when they could be had for 3-400k and commuted from home until that was built - or in my case, rented with my wife and kids until we had enough money to buy a tiny townhouse on St. Clair.

I'm not much of a Redditor so finally checked out this subreddit and Toronto one. Man, all the real estate threads are a hot mess. I saw some comments at the top with many likes that essentially make the same points as C did. I don't think we (individual home owners) acted in a way that is harmful to others but C seems to have different opinion than me. I want to hear more from you.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2020-07-06 17:11:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/hmaibw/my_friend_reads_this_subreddit_a_lot_and_now/,532
Is it ok to put all your life savings on a house ?,"Currently renting a detached for $3k in GTA, wife wants to buy but I am not convinced because of the obnoxiously high prices for the houses that we like (3 bed, newer construction, Oakville).

HHI is close to $300k, initial conversations with the bank gave me 5.54% 5 year fixed. Max they can lend is 1.45mil but I don’t want to stretch that much I am thinking 1-1.1mil if we find anything in that range.

But in order to have a mortgage that we can sustain we will have to put all our life savings, close to 40% of the house value!

I don’t like this idea of putting everything on a single asset and then starting from the beginning, it’s my 10 years worth of continuous hard work and struggle.

I am not sure if anyone can tell whether its a good time to buy a house or not.

Update: By all I mean will still be keeping emergency fund + closing costs.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2023-07-27 15:58:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/15b440b/is_it_ok_to_put_all_your_life_savings_on_a_house/,239
37m. Held off getting a car for this long and think it’s finally time. Am I being impulsive?,"Ok so I’ve been fortunate to hold off getting a car for a long time. I was always lucky my family would let me borrow when I need to do but I think it’s time I get my own. 

Having a car is still not necessary for me. I told myself I’d get one when I have a family but I can only control that part so much. I feel I’ve been living and saving so much without one for so long. I want to start going on more road trips without relying on friends, camping trips, visiting friends that are farther away, etc

Here is a summary:

- 37m and single, born and raised Canadian
- My salary is about $80k. I work as an IT developer and working more towards managing (switched careers and know I can make more. Tech sucks now). Expecting my salary to increase at the next job hop
- Rent is $950 to live alone in a one bedroom and I live 4min walk to the metro station in a fun walkable neighbourhood. I’m very grateful for my amazing apartment everyday. 
- I live in Montreal. No parking spot but I don’t mind street parking and moving it a couple times a week. In my experience, it takes me 5min circling around the block to find a free street parking spot within 5min walk. 
- I plan to not drive this car at all in the winter and leave at my parents garage. Don’t want to deal with moving a car without a parking spot and winter driving sucks in general. 
- Zero debts. 
- Maxed out TFSA and FHSA. 40k in RRSP. I’m estimating all my investments and savings are worth around over $250k. Right now, I have no issues topping up my TFSA and FHSA again once Jan 1 hits even after paying for a car within my budget
- Communauto car share is a great service and I plan to use it over the winter or even casually
- My budget for a used car is $4k-$6k and get something reliable
- My brother in law is offering a 2006 Toyota Solara (basically a Camry as a convertible) for a very reasonable price that falls in my budget. It has 130k km mileage. I might have to replace the timing belt eventually but that’s about it. This is also a car that’s easy to sell for a good price because it’s pretty rare
- I do want to buy a house at one point (probably this year) within my budget.

The theory of immigrants and foreign investors driving Canada's property market is about to be tested,"Article [here](https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/the-theory-of-immigrants-and-foreign-investors-driving-canadas-property-market-is-about-to-be-tested).

Vacancy rates in Canada’s two biggest housing markets are rising, rents are falling and luxury homes are struggling to be sold.

Christine Zhu, a Toronto-based realtor, has not facilitated a single purchase or sale on homes since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Her clientele are almost exclusively Chinese nationals whose kids are either already international students in Canadian universities and high schools in Ontario, or are looking to begin school this fall.

In a regular spring market, she would have processed at least eight sales every month, mostly condominium units that Chinese parents would purchase for their children, in addition to numerous rentals. This season she’s spending her days on the phone with landlords, negotiating on behalf of students who have gone back to China, and have no idea when they will return, leaving their leased apartments vacant. 

There are approximately 640,000 international students in Canada — over 50 per cent of them are Chinese and Indian nationals who make up a significant part of the rental market in Canada’s largest cities. In a typical summer season, tens of thousands of new foreign students, landed immigrants and non-permanent residents looking for work arrive in Canada, seeking some kind of housing, either to rent or buy.

But with international travel frozen, multiple realtors and housing experts the Financial Post spoke to over the course of the week say that the lack of the usual immigration and travel pattern is starting to have a noticeable impact on the housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver. In particular, vacancy rates are rising in downtown rental markets, pushing prices lower, while luxury homes that usually attract rich foreign investors are struggling to be sold leading to price drops or, in some cases, court-ordered sales. 

In April, the numbers of permanent residents admitted to Canada declined by 80 per cent from the year prior — just 4,140 were processed and admitted compared to 26,900 in April 2019, according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2020-06-23 16:02:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/heg6ko/the_theory_of_immigrants_and_foreign_investors/,546
Am I crazy to cash buy a house at this point?,"Guy in his 40's here, with partner approaching that and a toddler between us.
I have rented since my 20's. Never quite had enough $ to buy before and also tended to move for work every few years so it was simpler to do that.

We're currently paying $3800 a month in rent and we'd like to find a stable place to live for the kid, in BC.


Cut a long story short ontop of regular saving, the past couple years I got extremely ""lucky"" with stock market investments (thanks Jensen) and have enough cash on hand to buy a home in without the need to take on a mortgage...if I don''t go above our needs.


So to the question, given the sky high prices in BC, the interest rates, the rather uncertain financial future of Canada etc. is this year a crazy time to buy?

Should I wait even more or is the peace of mind etc. from home ownership worth any potential dowside of losing hundreds of thousands in a maybe downturn/crash?

Edit, this is what I am most concerned about (along with opportunity cost). For those who don't like AI, cmhc is the main citation which will tell you more https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/blog/2023/rising-rates-homeowners-greatest-shocks-lie-ahead


AI's answer to the question of what higher rates mean in the next few years:


Based on the information provided in the search results, it appears that a significant percentage of Canadian homeowners are set to face higher payments in the coming years as their loans reset to current market rates:

- Over 90% of Canadian mortgage holders have a rate below 5% as of early 2023. However, in 2024 and 2025, an estimated 2.2 million mortgages (45% of all outstanding mortgages in Canada) will be facing interest rate shock as they come up for renewal.[9]

- Most of these borrowers contracted their mortgages at record-low rates around 2020-2021 near the peak of housing prices. The total value of mortgage loans to be renewed in 2024-2025 represents over $675 billion, close to 40% of Canada's GDP.[9]

- As of May 2023, the share of variable-rate mortgages issued by chartered banks has fallen for 13 straight months to under 8%, down from 56% in January 2022, as borrowers flee to fixed rates.[1][5] 

- Over half (51%) of Canadians with variable-rate mortgages report difficulty making payments as of March 2023, compared to 30% of all homeowners. 45% of variable-rate borrowers say they would have to sell in under 9 months at current rates.[3][13]

- A Rates.ca analysis found that between July 2021 and September 2023, a homeowner with a variable-rate mortgage on a $500,000 loan paid $23,579 more in interest compared to if their rate had remained unchanged.[15]

So in summary, while under 10% of Canadian mortgages are currently variable-rate loans, a massive cohort of borrowers who took out both fixed and variable mortgages in 2020-2021 are set to renew at much higher rates in the next two years. Those with variable rates are already struggling with spiking payments. This shock to Canadian homeowners could have significant ripple effects on the housing market and broader economy in 2024-2025.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2024-03-23 21:52:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1bm414g/am_i_crazy_to_cash_buy_a_house_at_this_point/,116

"Remember: House Prices are set by the marginal buyer. No ""sell-off"" is needed with low volume.","Today's top thread asks why there isn't a massive housing sell-off in Canada right now, given that everything is being squeezed (and household budgets getting crushed)

The general consensus is that unless people are FORCED to sell, they'll probably avoid doing so in this environment, especially if they bought recently (as they'd be underwater).

So, barring any additional black swans (or a deeper than anticipated recession), there may not be a giant liquidation of houses like there was in the US during 2008.

HOWEVER

That doesn't mean prices will ""stabilize"" at these insane levels.

In fact, if the volume of sales stays low whilst affordability keeps drastically eroding - then all it will take to reprice every neighborhood in every Cdn city is just a consistent flow of ""forced sales"" (from things like death, bankruptcy, divorce, relocating for work, moving to / away from Canada, hardship, land assembly, people who bought 50 years ago for $19K, etc.)

And those will never stop.

But, obviously, if we start hitting 3-4+% overnight rates at the BoC for end of year / early 2023, mortgage rates are going to be 5-6%.

I know it's hard to believe, but not everyone is going to find a Saudi prince or Chinese Triad leader to overpay by $600K for their 80's bungalow. The vast majority of the buyers will be normal, taxpaying Canadian families.

(And almost NONE of the buyers for the short-term will be investors, since they all see this market trending down).

And as such, the prices that these sales settle at - as we're already clearly seeing - will be much lower than the height of the froth in Q1, and will simply continue heading lower & lower as rates climb.

In the meantime, Canada's economy will face increasing pressure from inflation and the impact of rate hikes, which is going to squeeze everyone's budgets, and basically just wipe out household spending on anything but the bare essentials.

**Bottom line:** Housing went on a Meme-stock ""number go up"" tear in 2021 & Q1 2022 because rates were deeply negative & the BoC was flooding the bond market with liquidity.

ALL of that is being reversed. Rapidly.

Housing isn't magically going to defy gravity. 

Enough forced-sales will happen, and they will reprice at what real people can actually afford. This will impact appraisal values, and reset the entire neighborhood comps as each sale processes.

If you think this can't happen, well... you're already seeing it. Record low sales volume. Massive price drops.

No giant sell-off needed.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2022-07-20 06:03:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/w3dqtk/remember_house_prices_are_set_by_the_marginal/,216
Canada should follow the Singapore property cooling measure (12% and 15% stamp duty tax on 2nd and 3rd property),"Link to article: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-property-cooling-measures-higher-absd-rates-loan-limit-10502710](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-property-cooling-measures-higher-absd-rates-loan-limit-10502710)

Today I stomped into this article from Singapore that they were implementing 12% and 15% stamp duty tax on 2nd and 3rd property. I would think that it will make housing more affordable for first time buyers and prevent speculation. It will be great if the Canadian government will look into this measure.

Moved in with my sister & brother in law to help save money during the pandemic and I feel I am now spending more than I was and also being taken advantage of.,"So this is going to seem like a bit of word vomit, but ive had his on my mind since I moved in and ive been stressing thinking about this for months. I am a 25 yr old culinary management grad & i currently work with the canadian forces reserves as an FSA making base pay as a private. 

My sister and brother in law offered me a place to stay with them back in the spring of this year . I was paying 600$ living in the city (close to everything) with a large room, adequate storage and my own bathroom & my lease being all inclusive. the only downside was the other 6 housemates & the 1 shared kitchen, the main reason i wanted to move being covid and all the housemates. 

My brother in law offered a rental rate we could ""work out together""  as well as use of his car (mazda 2005 with 250k on it),  i just needed to ""get it on the road"", they both made it seem like I would just be paying a light fee for monthly usage of the car ($60 was the price stated) with lower food costs/living costs and less house mates as well as the last 3 months rent being free, also having the peace of living in the country.

I was told as soon as i moved in rent would be $650 (+ first and last ) and $40 to improve the plan to get working internet in my room. next there was not enough space for all my belongings due to the smaller room and no closet, as well as a bathroom that I couldnt use on a daily basis near my room because it is a ""guest bathroom"" (while we have not had a single guest since i have moved in) along with a list of smaller charges from seemingly out of nowhere (my bike - after i paid cash to my brother in law to take it and get it fixed he charged me a unknown fee for it again) and then said he needed space in the garage and to put it ""elsewhere"" and then a $250 charge for a quote to fix the car, and new tires, next it was $1350 for the brakes - front and back, including brake lines which he said he would only charge me $400 for the front and back brakes ONLY just a week before, + $75 for the sticker, and lastly another $210 a month to use the car after i was told it would just be no more than $60. I feel since it is not my car and i did not put the rust damage on to the car that the price he was asking was a little steep, and I would have to pay this all 1 day before i was required to drive after i was accepted for a work tasking 40 min away with no bus route. mind you he said the vehicle would be ready to use in 2 weeks but it took a whole month and a half to get, i had to ride share for 2 days with another CAF member to base before it was ready.

When i tried to speak to him about all the unexpected costs, not to mention the 2 weeks i ran a kitchen at a hockey camp for him for free while he was sick with pancreaitis, he got really defensive and tells me he is here to ""help me"" and ""sometimes you just need to take a hit in life"" and ""thats just what the costs are"" as he wants me to pay the full price.. i have no lease and there is no statement saying what i would be entitled to with my rental, everything has been 100% verbal so far.

I dont feel i can negotiate or talk with him about any of this, and I also get the impression he looks down on me as someone who takes money from the government (crb while i was waiting for my transfer to complete and work to start) as he brought me in front of my sister and tried to get me to explain why i take crb when i had no other source of income talking over me calling me lazy and a drug addict, she wasnt very happy with him and how he generally just talks down to me with little respect which he says "" you have to earn"" but he says it isnt any of her business and she just stays quiet. I didnt move in expecting any of this, my father sister and brother all said it would be a good idea so o trusted them. i thought moving in with my sister would bring us and my brother in law closer together and be good for the family. Now all i feel is stress+depression, and that I am trapped here as rental prices in canada are getting very expensive , and i cant afford to move. I have nobody to speak with any of this about so any help or advice would be appreciated, thank you.

UPDATE

I took the advice of some of the wonderful commenters here and decided to move out ( to a low cost rental) at the end of september. I am currently thinking of moving to Trenton to work at the Air base (which i could bike/walk to). I am also considering changing to reg force at the end of the year when i finish my business admin course. things have been crazy and you all have helped immensely to seek and get the support i need. thank you.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-08-19 02:35:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/p751td/moved_in_with_my_sister_brother_in_law_to_help/,202
Inflation Calculations (CPI) Do Include the Price of Housing,"There is this notion that is especially pervasive online that Canada's inflation figures are artificially low because ""inflation doesn't include house prices"". 

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) aims accurately represent the average basket of goods that Canadians consume. Obviously, housing is a big part of that. That's why shelter makes up [29% of CPI](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/2018016/cpi-ipc-eng.htm) (and another 13% of CPI is for household furnishings and operations). Of course, that's much lower than what a new homeowner in a big city pays today, but most Canadians are not new homeowners in big cities. A huge portion of Canadians own their home and have paid off their mortgage, or live in a rural area with relatively cheap housing.

Inflation affects everyone differently, and that's why Statistics Canada provides [a Personal Inflation Calculator](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020cal-eng.htm) where you can enter your general expenses and get what the rate of inflation is for *your* basket of goods. Using this calculator, we can see that a budget made up of only food and rent has had an inflation rate of more than double the official rate over the last two years.

Anyway, the bottom line is that the cost of housing is represented in the CPI. There are certainly some reasonable things that can be debated over for how CPI is measured and reported, but the methodology for the most part makes sense. The price of housing is included in that methodology (and takes up a larger share than any other category) and inflation statistics are published for each category separately (including for shelter).",PersonalFinanceCanada,2024-12-20 10:37:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1higafm/inflation_calculations_cpi_do_include_the_price/,24
Don't Feel Bad About Renting,"Edit: Lot's of great reasons to buy as pointed out in the comments, not saying anything different. I just think renting gets too much hate and the idea of homeownership as the only or best vehicle for wealth is way overblown. 

\---

**This is a long post so here's my point: I wouldn't feel bad about renting for a long time. It can make a lot of financial sense. I want to own a home eventually but plan to let my investments grow for at least a decade or two before I consider it. I get frustrated by a lot of the standard thinking/advice I hear on the subject and so I wanted to share my take. If you strongly agree or disagree, please let me know- I'm really curious how other people are thinking about this.**

I want to share a few thoughts in this sub for anyone who is feeling bad about having to rent because homeownership is out of reach financially. I'm 26 and living in Toronto. I want to own a home eventually but plan to rent for a long time because I think it makes more financial sense in my situation.

I'd encourage anyone aged \~18-45 to consider the analysis below if you feel like renting is ""throwing your money away"" and that it's impossible to build real wealth if you can't get into the real estate market now. A house is one vehicle of many to build meaningful wealth over the next 20 years and I would argue that it's not the best option for most people.

Consider the following example:

**Buying**

The avg. home price in Toronto is \~1.2mm today. Let's say the great policy ideas discussed today all get implemented and work perfectly and the average home price drops to an optimistic \~800k. As a homeowner, your annual cost could break down something like this (ignoring all the one-time purchase costs and mortgage principal):

* Interest on debt: $9,650
* Maintenance: $6,000
* Insurance: $1,200
* Utilities: $4,800
* Property tax: $3,600
* Total: \~25k or let's say $20,000 - $30,000 depending on your assumptions

**Renting**

What if you're renting a comparable property? Today that would cost roughly $3000 - 4000 per month but let's assume our great policies have driven down rental prices as well and you can rent for $2000 - 2,500 a month or $24,000 - $30,000 per year (again, depending on a variety of things.)

**Conclusion & other considerations**

I've done this math a few different times for different areas and find that renting is either roughly equivalent or slightly more expensive than buying. Of course, you will one day pay off your loan at which time it becomes far cheaper to own on an annual basis. So, let's say you do always pay a premium to rent, what do you get for it? I think of it in these terms:

* **Opportunity costs**: The downpayment on your home for most will be most if not all your savings, what else could you do with that money? You may be missing out on much better investment opportunities (in terms of risk and reward) in the public stock/bond markets because your capital is tied up in your home. In the last 20-30 years, there were few public investment opportunities as lucrative as owning a Canadian home - what about the next 20-30 years? Don't just be the exit liquidity for boomers!
* **Diversification**: Again, for most, after purchasing a home your investment portfolio just became 80-90% Canadian residential real-estate. Your wealth is now tied to the future of your neighborhood (for some, the best possible investment they could make, but for most - quite risky)
* **Liquidity**: There are ways to access the equity in your home without selling it, but it's not free, it's not always easy and there are [significant risks associated](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/11/helocs-can-hurt-you.asp).
* **Flexibility**: When you rent it's easier to pack up and move when you actually want to

\---

Assumptions/sources:

Naturally, these numbers can change a lot depending on your situation and the assumptions that you use. I tried to be as neutral as possible to illustrate my point but for full transparency here are my assumptions and I'd encourage everyone to go and do the math for yourself if you haven't already.

If anyone's interested in doing the calculation themselves and playing with the assumptions I used the [TD mortgage calculator](https://tools.td.com/mortgage-payment-calculator/), [City of Toronto Property Tax Calculator](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/property-taxes-utilities/property-tax/property-tax-calculator/property-tax-calculator/), [Operating costs](https://cansumer.ca/buying-house-cost/). Other assumptions: 25% down payment, 20-year amortization @ 3% fixed rate.

\---

Notes

* I have absolutely nothing to do with the loan/real estate industry or government whatsoever - just another guy trying to navigate the housing mess as best I can
* The intrinsic value or ""feeling"" that comes with owning a home is important but completely personal and impossible to quantify. It's invaluable to some and moot to others so I haven't included it.

The cost of owning a home in Vancouver (88% of income) has hit crisis levels,https://business.financialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/canadian-housing-affordability-worsened-in-q1-ending-one-quarter-reprieve-rbc,PersonalFinanceCanada,2018-07-04 02:07:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8vxjso/the_cost_of_owning_a_home_in_vancouver_88_of/,235
Question re: tax write off optimization,"Hello all,

I'm Canadian in the US. I'm planning to make a permanent move back to Canada (Vancouver to be precise) next April-May. Before I give relevant details, I'll start with my big question: How much should I put down as a home downpayment when I buy in 1-3 years post-move so as to optimize for long-term savings? 

Relevant considerations:  
\* I'll be turning 44 a few months after I arrive in Vancouver;

\* No dependents; 

\* I'll arrive with something like $1-1.1M CDN. Of this, around $300K will already be invested, w/ the remainder being what I get for selling my house, my emergency fund, and my Health Savings Account;

\* My work income will be in the $90-100K CDN range based on a typical work week in the 25-30 hr/week range;

\* I'm not aiming to retire in the 65-67 range. Rather, as I get old I plan to gradually reduce my workload. e.g., Maybe somewhere in the age 60 range I cut back to 20-25 hrs/week for like 46 weeks of the year (doing more traveling), and keep this coming into my 70s. 

\* I'll be working as an independent contractor and will be able to write off like 40% of my rent (pre-buying) for home office, and then my mortgage interest post-purchase. I'll also have a ton of other write-offs -- e.g., 1/2 of car expenses, fuel, cell phone/plan, computer stuff, etc.;

\* approx condo price range: $750-920 CDN;

\* I plan to max out my RRSP and TFSA contributions every year (or come as close to that as possible);

\* My investments will include stock ETFs that diversity across country, sector, etc., will have some recession protection holdings (e.g., consumer staple ETFs, gold). As I get older, I'll gradually lean more into dividend and consumer staple ETFs, bonds, etc., and taper my stock ETF investments.

  
Re-stating the question: What do people think in terms of approx how much to put in for down payment and how much to try to pay down my mortgage ahead of schedule so as to optimize for tax write-offs and ability to make investment gains with the money that I'm investing as opposed to putting into paying off the condo?

ELI5: How has inflation been ~2% per year over the last decade when the cost of living has nearly doubled in that time?,"So this is something I've been trying to wrap my head around for a while. Inflation is supposed to be the relative difference in the value of currency in a country over time. And it's generally understood that the inflation rate in Canada has been relatively stable at \~2% per year over the last couple of decades. This seems to be more or less conventional wisdom.   

What I don't understand is where that number comes from when the cost of living is increasing at a much faster pace. The cost of housing in Canada has doubled in many location over the last decade. For most people, that alone is their biggest expense. And then there is the price of gas, which is up \~50% in the last decade. And then the price of produce which I will anecdotally say is up \~50% in the last decade alone. Lastly, the Canadian dollar is down 25% in the last decade against the American dollar, making all imported products significantly more expensive than they were a decade ago. 

To me it seems like housing, gasoline, produce, and imported goods would encompass more than half of regular expenses for most Canadians. And all of those things have gone up at a rate MUCH higher than 2%. And yet inflation is still \~2%. What am I missing?",PersonalFinanceCanada,2019-05-04 00:34:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/bkf08v/eli5_how_has_inflation_been_2_per_year_over_the/,304

Parenting advice nowadays meant that we bought a place with at least one bedroom per kid and bathroom, when having my own bedroom growing up would have been quite a luxury and we only had two bathrooms for a family of 5.

"PSA: You don't need to own property, renting is just as good if not better","It seems like wherever I go on reddit, Canadians feel a need to own a home whether it makes financial sense or not. They have a feeling that it's the logical progression from renting and don't have any real numbers - they just remember being sold a ""dream"" as kids that they would own their own home, get married and have a well paying job. Seems like there's been push back on the second and third points yet everyone still feels like they need to own a home. 

The reality is that owning property frequently leaves you behind in net income/net profit even if you save on rent. It's basically like this - would you rather earn 3k income from investments but pay 2k in rent or earn 0 and pay 0? Obviously this isn't always the case - sometimes it is better to own than rent... I'm just surprised by the number of people who just unquestioningly see it as the end goal. Personally, I'm making a fair bit over 6 figures and owning just hasn't been something I've felt any need to rush into... (Aside from the fact that the FHSA is probably going to drive housing prices to go up even more at the cost to future generations I suspect)

Some napkin math

Rent

1. Instead of 100k down payment -> invest in GIC @ 5%. 5k return per year. Can go into stock market for better returns
2. Rent @ 2k x 12 = 24k a year
3. Net income -19k in housing expenses

Buy

1. 100k down payment, 400k mortgage @ 5% -> First year 
2. 0 income due to not having any money to invest
3. 20k in mortgage interest
4. Tack on property tax, utilities, maintenance, condo fees, various property manager type tasks (i.e. replacing appliances) and you're probably -30k

Obviously this is just napkin math to demonstrate a ""proof of concept"", YMMV.

What to do with all this money?,"Cross posting from r/personalfinance   
  
Hello Everybody I am seeking advice as I lack the brainpower and expertise to do all these calculations myself.

I will find myself with about 120k CAD in savings in a few years if all goes well conservative estimate, I will have to buy a car and I want to take a month or two off to travel a bit before going home). I am currently working in the UK and saving about £1000/month and I have about 64K CAD currently in my savings account back home. I will be moving back to Canada late 2027/early 2028 and I don't know what the best course of action is, or exactly what I should do now to maximize my savings. Here's the breakdown of what's happening with my money at the moment:

\~24k CAD in regular savings annual interest rate of 1.5% (I think it get a dividend as well, credit union)  
\-40k CAD in a term deposit maturing on the 16th April 2026 at an interest rate of 4.00%  
\-£6.5k in a savings account with a monthly interest of 1.24% with £850 added monthly  
\-£600 in another account with a 6.00% monthly interest rate. Max contribution is £150 a month up to £5k.

The questions:

1. There doesn't seem to be a transfer limit to send money from the UK to Canada, so I'm wondering if I should transfer £12k every year from my UK account to my Canadian account, or at least when my term deposit matures to mush that money together and leave it in there for another 18months, or would I get more by leaving it in the UK?
2. Should I buy a house? That is what I was planning to do with the money, just throw it all at a modest, two bedroom condo or house (there are some in the town I want to reside in that are less than 200K), but I'm not sure if with the price of realtor fees, a mortgage, possible future repairs, insurance, and property taxes if it's really going to be worth it? My bestie's bf just became a realtor so he can get me a deal though.
3. I will likely also look into switching banks, or opening a savings account with another bank that offers a savings account with a higher monthly interest rate, then I could chuck all that money in there and rent a bachelor's apartment with the interest?

I would prefer not to invest the money in anything high risk, I already have a little money in stocks and it is not doing well haha. Mostly because I suck at it, but also because of the economy rn.

I also don't want to buy any investment properties or whatever at the moment. Someone floated to me that I could buy a couple of homes maybe and rent one out, but I would prefer to sort my own dwelling out before getting something as an investment. Maybe in a few more years.

As for income... at the moment I just work as a lowly receptionist. I have half a plan to study and skill up, maybe general accounting or HR, but I really hate studying haha.

I mean if people can't afford it, then who buys them? Isn't the price point of anything depending on what is someone willing to pay for it. So someone is willing to pay more and more for these houses, then wouldn't that mean that earning 75k a year is more on the low end of things?

I guess I'm just confused I'm quite young so I'm not sure about these things, but when I read that so many people can't afford to buy homes, then who's buying them? why are the prices increasing? what is going on?

Mixed Messages from Mortgage Brokers,"Greetings!

I know there's a sub for first-time homebuyers but I'm looking for Canadian financial advice, for reference I'm in Ontario.

I have a big dream of owning a small house with my fiance, I've got a modest down payment of 30k, decent income, and aiming for Northern Ontario where starter homes are still around 250K. My biggest issue is this monster of a personal loan I have, which is almost the same as an estimated mortgage payment. I couldn't possibly afford both a mortgage and the loan, and with my fiancé's credit score being super duper low and him being unemployed when we first move, it's gonna be all on me with my work from home job.

So I enlisted the assistance of a mortgage broker, who told me it would absolutely be no problem to get a mortgage of 300k and with a home purchase price of 260k - people do it all the time he said, I could have it pre-approved for you in a week or so. It's now been a month and he's just stopped all communications. So I reached out to a different broker, who said absolutely no way will any lender do that, especially with only 5-10% down payment. 

So now I don't know who to believe or what to do next. I want to keep on track with my savings plan but is it better to just pay down this stupid loan, re-term it so the payments are lower, and try again when I get my savings back up? Or is it possible to get a mortgage above purchase price and make this big dream come true?

Thank you in advance.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2025-02-10 19:58:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1imdw7s/mixed_messages_from_mortgage_brokers/,2
Torn on potential condo purchase,"Hi everyone,

I've never posted anything like this, but I am curious as to what everyone else thinks. I've been saving to purchase a condo for myself in BC. I live in the interior and am positioned to live here for the foreseeable future with my current job.
See
Purchasing a house is out of the question as the average house is far above what I can afford, but the condo in question is well priced, has the best location in town as it can get, building is well maintained, and is a top for corner unit. The caveat is the previous owner was a slumlord, and the last tenants smoked in the unit which will require a bit of work to make it more habitable.

My realtor is confident we can get a real good price on it, but my one concern is I don't want to sink all my savings into a home and have all my equity tied up. On the other hand, I would likely still have some savings left over after and it would be good to break into the real estate market and have that bit of freedom on my own as opposed to renting...

I currently have 19400 in a FHSA and 17400 in my TFSA available to me for 36800 total.

Can likely get the unit for 270k making a 5% down payment 13500 leaving 23300 left.

After speaking with some local contractors, I can get the unit drywall finishing/primed/painted/fixed up for about 6500 leaving 16800 left. I also still need to price out some new flooring as well, but I may wait on this a bit but would be nice to get it all done at once.

I am unsure of closing costs and lawyer fees, plus a few additional things id need to purchase as well (i.e. some livingroom furniture).

Biggest concern is having some savings left over for an emergency fund. I have an additional 7500 which I hold for this purpose but would like to hang onto some investments, ideally around the 10k remaining mark.

I currently pay 850 for rent, which my mortgage would be around 1450 plus 240 for condo fees, and 136 for property tax monthly. I make 90k a year and this would be within my means as I'd still have my RSP contributions, employee stock plan, and contributions to my TFSA.

I never thought I could potentially be a homeowner before, so I guess my question is, is this realistic and potentially a good opportunity for myself and my future? Or any other opinions on it?

Thank you for reading and your insights!",PersonalFinanceCanada,2024-12-30 19:15:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1hpthyy/torn_on_potential_condo_purchase/,6
"Buy out of province, or wait?","I'm looking for some advice from people who pay more attention to the economy than I do. I have about 15 years till it's time to retire, and I want to buy a house to add to my retirement income. I currently rent in Ontario, as I cannot afford a home here, nor would I qualify for mortgage on my own. I'm tired of wasting $25K/yr on rent when I could be putting it towards a mortgage. My job is 100% remote, so I'm looking to buy a townhouse in the Calgary area (approx. $350K), live there for 15 years, and pay off all or most of my mortgage by the end of that time. At that point I would sell the house, move back to Ontario and use that money to pay rent or put a significant down payment on an apartment. At least, that has been my plan for the past 6 months. 

In the last month or so I've started hearing rumblings that the Canadian RE market, specifically in Ontario, is in for a huge crash, similar to 2008 in the US. One article stated that housing prices could fall by 25% in the fall, or 40% by next spring. Interest rates are already rising, and the market seems to be cooling - albeit very slightly. 

The only reason I would move to Calgary is to buy a house that I can more or less pay off in 15 years. I don't know a single person there, all my family is here, and my mother is getting older so there is a very good chance that she wouldn't be around when I'm ready to move back. All things being equal, I would choose to stay in Ontario.

On the other hand, if I stay here and the RE market stays the same, I've lost more time and paid more rent with nothing to show for it. Interest rates will be even higher, and it could affect whether I pay off the house in 15 years.

What are your thoughts on the next year or so in the RE market in Canada, and specifically Ontario?",PersonalFinanceCanada,2022-05-01 17:21:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ug3e71/buy_out_of_province_or_wait/,32
[Ontario] The step-by-step guide of how I bought a cottage,"I've learned so much from the various subreddits as a first-time home buyer, including from the r/PersonalFinanceCanada community. I wanted to share my experience of buying a cottage while living in downtown Toronto, in case there are others thinking about doing something similar. I currently rent, and decided in October to buy my first property. Last week, my offer was accepted and I close at the end of March.

**tl;dr The market in cottage country is just as hot as Toronto if you're looking for a waterfront property. I viewed 8, and put offers on 4. There were 12 to 24 registered offers on each property I bid on, with basically everyone waiving conditions (bleh).**

How it played out:

* Property 1: Offered $50k over ask, with conditions. Sold $109k over ask. (Nov 2020)
* Property 2: Offered $142k over ask. Sold $277k over ask. (Jan 2021)
* Property 3: Offered $152k over ask. Sold $262k over ask. (Jan 2021)
* Property 4: Offered $207k over ask. Offer was accepted. (Feb 2021)

Except for the first offer, I waived conditions on all and went with a 30 day close and 10% deposit (apparently standard is 5%, but could be as little as $5k if you're buying in an extremely rural area). Ask your local realtor what is standard for the region.

To be clear, buying my first home had been on my mind for several years, but the soaring price of Toronto real estate meant either settling for a cramped condo with weird layouts, or (preferably) kicking the can further down the road so I didn’t have to think about it. In the meantime, I continued to pay rent and invest any remaining funds in ETFs.

I highly recommend making sure you’re on the last step of r/PersonalFinanceCanada's ‘Money Steps’ guide before going down the path of buying a cottage. This guide was so incredibly helpful, and something I've referenced many times over the years.

My financial setup, prior to buying:

* Paid under market rent in a downtown, rent-controlled apartment building (moved in 2014)
* Split the cost of rent with my partner
* Walked or took public transit, did not own a vehicle
* Built up a sizeable emergency fund, maxed out my TFSA and RRSP accounts, and maxed out my employer match for ESPP
* Invested “leftover” funds in ETFs through TD Direct Investing (Canadian Couch Potato) and Wealthsimple on a monthly basis
* Emergency fund was stored at EQ Bank and Simplii
* Tracked my net worth and savings rates on a quarterly basis (I used The Measure of a Plan Budget Tracker)
* Focused on reducing unnecessary expenditures, and becoming more disciplined with grocery shopping and meal prep

I am what you would consider fairly frugal and financially risk averse, and I lurk a lot on this subreddit. Other than splurging on travel several times a year, my day-to-day living expenses focused on the basics. I also want to acknowledge how fortunate I was to remain employed during the pandemic, which ended up accelerating my savings rate by a significant amount. Once I made the decision to buy a cottage, things moved relatively quickly. Here are the steps I followed:

Step 1: 

I interviewed several realtors to gain an understanding of price range, market conditions and available inventory. From algae blooms to flood plains, I learned a lot about water quality from realtors who grew up in rural areas. I wasn't entirely sure what area I wanted to buy in, so I used a combination of realtor referrals from friends and from www.GetKeys.ca (super helpful if your friend circle doesn't have any realtor recommendations).

Step 2:

Next, I got a pre-approval through [myperch.io](https://myperch.io). I used a lot of their online tools to validate my thinking and ensure I was ready for the financial commitment.

Step 3: 

I downloaded apps like [Redfin.ca](https://Redfin.ca) and [HouseSigma.com](https://HouseSigma.com) to monitor sold prices in the areas I was interested in. At this point, I basically was looking at under 300 km from Toronto, or a max 3 hour drive (...let's just pretend rush hour traffic on a Friday isn't a thing).

Step 4:

Once I felt ready to start searching, I reviewed listings with my realtor to identify needs, wants and red flags. This stage was really important for learning what could be easily fixed (adding a heated water line) and what I wasn't willing to deal with (structural foundation issues or replacing septic). Admittedly, as a self-described ""city girl"" who grew up in Toronto, my realtor was also able to point out things I hadn't considered about living rurally, such as year-round road access, available cell service, internet, etc.

Note: I reached out to any friends and family who I knew owned a cottage, grew up rurally, or had experience with septic tanks, drilled wells, lake intake water, wood stoves, etc. I used this informal network to review listings I was considering, or to look over septic permits or inspection documents. It's so helpful to have someone on your side who doesn't stand to financially gain from your purchase!

Step 5:

Next up, I went to multiple viewings with my realtor to validate those learnings. I wasn't asked to sign a Buyer's Representation Agreement (BRA) until I was ready to make my first offer. While in Toronto, you might sign a BRA for a specific address or suburb, in cottage country I found BRAs covered much larger areas (although you can negotiate this). For example, I signed a BRA for Muskoka, Haliburton, and Kawarthas with the same realtor. I also had realtors lined up across southern Ontario, such as Tobermory, Peterborough, north of Kingston, Ottawa, etc. In all cases, I made it very clear what areas I had signed a BRA for.

The offer paperwork was all signed remotely with DocuSign, which made it pretty convenient. As a first time buyer, I found it helpful to look up a standard Agreement of Purchase and Sale document online so I could familiarize myself before submitting any offers.

**If you use an online bank like Tangerine, EQ Bank, or Simplii, make sure you transfer your deposit amount into a standard Big 5 bank prior to making any offers.** In the event your offer is accepted, you'll have 24 hours to get the deposit to the listing brokerage so make sure your money isn't on hold somewhere. Online banks can take a few days to get a bank draft made, whereas Big 5 banks can do it on the spot - just walk into any bank branch and show some ID.

Step 6:

After facing the reality of a hot seller's market, I reviewed my finances again to understand how high I could comfortably go. The mortgage broker was super helpful in teaching me about Type A vs. Type B cottages, owner occupied vs. non-owner occupied, and understanding the impact of fixed vs. variable rates. **If you take away nothing else from this post, make sure you know the difference between Type A (year-round) and Type B (seasonal) cottages. Type B cottages need a minimum 10% down payment and the max loan amount is $350,000. Also, wood stoves do not count as a permanent heat source!** Make sure to keep your broker in the loop if you're not sure how a cottage might be classified. This saved me from making a potentially very expensive mistake.

Step 7:

As I mentioned earlier in this post, I ended up viewing 8 properties and made 4 offers. Just like you would research status certificates and builder reputation on a condo in Toronto, you'll need to look at municipality sites, water testing results, flood plain maps, etc. Assuming you have a well established local realtor, make sure to have them try and find out the spread of offers. This gives you an idea of how many people have higher budgets than you, or if you've been priced out of the area and need to look elsewhere.

Step 8:

Constantly review your list of needs vs. wants and comparable solds to get a feel for where the market is going. I ended up compromising on location and going just north of Muskoka. I also had to waive conditions to remain competitive, but made sure to mitigate the risks of doing so.

Step 9:

Once my offer was accepted, I started calling around to get quotes for a real estate lawyer. After speaking to several Toronto lawyers, they all recommended I go with a local option due to the intricacies of buying in a rural area. I asked my realtor for recommendations, and got quotes from 4 local lawyers. **When shopping around, make sure to ask for a detailed cost breakdown of the legal fee (flat or hourly), disbursements, title insurance, etc.**

The broker already had a bunch of documents from my pre-approval, so it was a relatively straightforward matter to re-upload and refresh some of the key items (letter of employment, account statements showing funds in the account for 90 days). He went through the details of the mortgage commitment letter, answered any questions I had, and then I signed it remotely through DocuSign.

Step 10:

The final bits:

Appraisal - The broker booked the appraisal and gave me the estimated costs so I knew ahead of time to prepare for it. Given I'm buying in a rural area, it's probably a bit more expensive than in the city since there's less competition. I'm waiting to confirm, but it sounds like it will be between $350 to $550.

Insurance - I'm in the process of shopping around now, but I used my realtor and some local Facebook groups (for the town, or cottage association) for recommendations.

As I mentioned, I'm closing at the end of March so this is as far as I've gotten in the process. But hopefully some of you find this helpful!

What is the end Game of Toronto and Vancouver Real estate prices?,"I want to hear your thoughts at how this price appreciation trend goes in 5 to 10 years.

As I observe house prices steadily increasing in 2 of the largest markets in Canada where wages have not kept up, what is the end game?

Before I could kind of understand that there was wiggle room as interest rates could be lowered, but now where is the money that will fuel the future Real Estate transactions.

Where will the wiggle room be for prices to go up even more? I kind of get it that parental help is now crucial for Millennial Canadians to get a leg up and maybe afford a 2 bed condo in the GTA or lower mainland, and for older millennials, they use the price appreciation of their starter condo to fuel the purchase of their town home or house. Now that the burbs are catching up with the prices in the GTA and Vancouver, how do working couples(new immigrants or not) with average or slightly above average incomes without a family windfall get their foot in the market? These are the families that will need to be able to afford the starter condos in order for the condo owners to be able to afford a bigger place.

What will happen at a societal level where let’s say a decently paid worker without an inheritance or substantial savings cannot afford to become a homeowner? Will there be huge demands from Gen Z workers for higher wages, or will companies slowly start leaving the two largest markers? Will wealthy immigrants fill in the void as locals without savings become priced out? I know of a few foreign students with whom I studied that from their perspective that real estate here is really cheap (Canadian dollar is much lower than US dollar) and when generally compared to Chinese cities, Canada is safer and cleaner (their words not mine).

Will we suffer a price crash like in the 90s or will Toronto become more like Hong Kong and New York or other global cities where renting becomes the norm and Canadians need to figure out their retirement without seeing having property to their name?

I am asking just to see what your educated guesses are. I thought Covid of all events would in theory depress prices, but I see now that real estate is really resilient to price pressure.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update: I love the thoughtful responses. Lots to think about.

I wanted to also ask, what happens to condo prices as generally there is a significant condo fee appreciation year on year. What happens to glass tower condo prices when the glass siding reaches end of life? Do you see prices declining as the fees gobble up potential mortgage payments from new buyers? Are condo purchases a game of musical chairs where one wants to stay in one until major repairs are required for the building and then the prices for those condos declines?

Update2: Now that we have  an explosion in bidding wars and increased prices all over Ontario and Lower Mainland in 2021, do you see this trend become a catalyst for Canadians to move to Alberta and other provinces?

"Economic Update - Canadian & US Economy, Employment, Trade Wars & NAFTA, GTA Housing - [LONG]","This morning I was at a PD event where Benjamin Tal Chief Economist at CIBC World Markets gave a lengthy speech. Last time I heard him speak, 2 year ago, I posted a summary about it here and it was well received. [I went to look back]( https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/4jwni7/economic_outlook_and_housing/) and the projection / outlook was nothing groundbreaking but wasn’t wrong. 

**2018 / 2019 Canadian Economy**

2017 was a great year, Canadian GDP was 1.2% above expectations. Which equates to $10.5B in increased tax revenue for the Government. Which equates to $6B going into our economy and $4.5B going to Kinder Morgan (haha). Eurozone and Japan were 0.6 and 0.5% above expectations but that is because they have negative interest rates, and keep printing money. US on the other hand a fraction of a percent above expectations.

What’s going to happen in 2018. - There is a 0% chance that Canada will be 1.2% above expectation and that is solely the responsibility of economists. In 2017 the numbers came out each quarter and they were good/great. So, they upped their forecast. Started at 3.3% GDP growth for 2017, but each Q of good numbers they upped it like a stair case, all the way to 3.5%. However for each projected increase in 2017, they also upped the 2018 projected GDP growth. So by Jan2018 they expected 2018 GDP to grow by 3.7%. Compared to May 2017, they were only expecting GDP to grow 3.4% in 2018. So still positive news, but it’s been priced into the markets by now.


**Is a recession looming?**

2009-Today = the second longest expansion period in Canada and US economics in terms of time. However, in terms of GDP % growth, it’s only grown about 13% (I have a graph so can’t see it’s between 10 and 15%) That’s good for 5th highest, but by far. Other expansion periods were 37%, 30%, 28%, 18%. So maybe we still have some time to go. And the reason for this is all the worlds economies aren’t trying to rapidly grow. SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE. We are all tortoises no hares.

Why are the world economies slowing down growth? – Demographics. China the one child policy has caught up to them. Europe and North America the populations are aging, and the families didn’t have as many kids as they did 30-50 years ago.

**Euro – crash looming?**

We saw what happened with Greece collapsed. Which is the next domino to fall? Could it be Italy? Italy is a much bigger impact than Greece, their economy is much bigger. With a negative interest rate they are trying to encourage innovation, but at the same time they are discouraging foreign investment. 

When the BOC announced news, June 12, 2017 “Economy is good” compared to all the prior speeches “Economy is flat or bad” the CAD went up 5%. After the first BoC rate hike, it went up 4%. After the 2nd hike in Sept it went up 10%. When Mario Draghi tweeted in June that the EU may raise interest rates the Euro went up 22%. People are speculating if interest rates rise in the EU, foreign investment will flock there.


**Trump; his tax cut & his trade war**

The ‘Biggest Ever’ Corporate tax cut was actually the 8th biggest since 1920. The guy ran on ‘Make America Great Again.’ Put American interests first. This was a step towards that.  It did decrease tax revenue by an estimated $1.5 Trillion. 

The Tax cut will increase the bottom line of public US companies 8% - 9%. Get in on the S&P500 (until 2020)

Now the corporate tax rate in the US is lower than Canada’s, foreign investors will flock their over Canada. (My take: when everyone was saying Amazon HQ2, come to Toronto, I said no chance due to this. Compared to US cities willing to give $1B in tax cuts on an already lower tax rate.) 

Another big step is Deregulation of industries. The Office of Information and Regulatory affairs pumps out basically 1 new rule a working day for the past 16 years (200-250.) Under Trump in 2017,  under 50. Dodd-Frank is being rolled back. Less regulation in the banking industry. 

100% amortization for new or used machinery. They want Companies to go out and spend on machinery, spend on manufacturing in the US.

After Trump announced a one time lower tax rate on re-patriated money. The US saw $2.6 Trillion come back.

The US is fortunate, under Donald Trump they are no subject to Global Warming. It doesn’t apply to them! There is no Carbon Tax.

With the above steps and the possibility of NAFTA being torn up, if you are a Global Player… are you going to A) Build your headquarters in Toronto. Pay higher taxes and have the possibility of not being able to ship your products into the US, a market 10x the size of Canada. B) build your office in the US?

**Employment in Canada and the US**

As of 2017, 65% of people aged 25-54 are employed. That’s down from 75% in 1997. What Is the reason, people are getting a later start to work, and staying in school longer. Conversely, 76% of people aged over 55 are still working, that is up from 68% in 1997. People aren’t retiring as early. 

The # of hours being worked by the people 55+ which is surprisingly still a large part of the workforce, and growing, is actually dropping. 32 hours worked a week, compared to 35 for those 25-54. 

Canada – you’re a top country in terms of % of people getting post-secondary education. But you’re the #1 country with people with a post-secondary degree and still living in poverty. Even as the costs of your schooling is the fraction of the US schooling costs. Why is this? Because no one wants to employ someone and pay them $100,000 if their major is in Art History. (Or to quote Ben Shapiro, the Occupy Wall-Street Movement, was started by grads with degrees in Lesbian Dance Theory, pissed off no one wants to give them jobs in their field.) People are not getting degrees that are going to get them jobs.

Over 30% of college students in Canada are students who already finished a university degree.

Job creation is not helping the middle class. Jobs are being created at the low-end and high-end of skill level. So the idea of jumping in and working your way up, isn’t really applying since the middle level isn’t taking any new people. 


**Trade Wars**

US doesn’t care about Canada. They care about China. There is [Made in China 2025]( https://www.google.ca/search?q=what+is+made+in+china+2025&rlz=1C1CHZL_enCA716CA716&oq=what+is+made+in+china+2025&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j0.4559j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) initiative that the US wants to stop. 70% of the tarriffs put on the Trumps Targetted Products list are on the Made in China 2025 list. I.E Trump has someone really smart behind the scenes. The US Government has been blocking multiple attempts for Chinese Companies to merge with US companies, in an effort to hold back China and continue to maintain power in certain industries.

'#of Antidumping Petitions filed under Trump (1.5 yrs) =  27.

'#filed under Obama’s 8 years = 10

'#Under G.W. Bush’s 8 years = 6

They are serious about protecting their border.

**NAFTA**

Trump holds the power, the US will come out with a better deal than before. Canada won’t be that worse off but good luck to Mexico.

**GTA Housing**

Tal concluded with this topic. He opened with “The GTA market up until 2016 made perfect sense. I had models, everything was explainable. Then 2016 happened and none of my models work. If none of my models work, something is bad.” – meant as a joke.

Interest rates – BoC will raise it in July 2018. Then again 1 time in 2019. That’s it until 2020. They want a weak dollar but can the people support it? 

Consumer debt is 170% of annual income. 

•	60% of debt is Fixed Mortgages

•	15% of debt is variable mortgages

•	5% is Fixed- Term Loans

•	10% - Secured personal Lines of Credit

•	5% Unsecured Personal lines of Credit

•	4% Credit Cards

•	1% other.


What is interesting to note, of the increases in rates we saw in the past 12 months, it only affected 15% of the debt. Only the Lines of Credit. The variable mortgage holders, kept their payments the same, just extended the amortization. So we raised interest rates 3 times, we haven’t seen the economy collapse, in fact the opposite 2nd half of 2017 continued to grow, Let’s keep going… NO go slow, you only affected 15%. What happens within 3 years when close to 50% of the mortgages come due?

The new Stress Test – Removed 12% of the buyers from getting a mortgage from a regulated bank. HOWEVER, it did not remove 12% of the demand. In fact, the growth of the Private Mortgage Indusry is huge. (My take, I give personal mortgages, rates are actually down in 2018 (8%) vs. 2017 (9.5%), since so many people are getting into this and there is so much money around to loan.) This is very scary for the Bank of Canada. Risk is being transferred from the Public eye of the regulated banks to the Private Unregulated market.

Condo Market is going crazy. 52% of all condo sales are by buyers with the intention of renting it out. It’s driving up prices. BUT

Of every 100 Landlords who close in 2017 (per year)

•	44 are cash flow positive between $0 and $500

•	9 are cash flow positive between $501 and $1,000

•	2 are cash flow positive making over $1,000 

•	20 are cash flow negative between $0 and $500

•	9 are cash flow negative between $501 and $100

•	16 are cash flow negative over $1,000 a year.


The mindset of the people are this isn’t a GIC, I’m not looking for an annual return. I want to hold this and maybe one day give it to my kid so he can afford to live in Toronto. Maybe I’ll sell it in 30 years to fund my retirement. If I’m negative now, fine, but I have someone paying off the mortgage component at least.

Overall the condo market is getting worse, I.E prices are going up. While freestanding is down in the past year, that won’t stay for long.

Should we diversify by investing in a condo in Vancouver ? ,"My wife (26) and I (29) both make around $500k in household income per year. We don’t have any kids and don’t plan to have any in the future. We currently own a townhome in Vancouver, which we purchased for around $790k in 2023. The house is currently valued at $860k.

Here are our assets, listed in order:

**Husband**

* Cash: $30k in HISA
* Non-registered: $250k in broad market ETFs
* FHSA: $20k
* RRSP: $100k
* Company stocks: $200k vested (with $800k unvested)
* TFSA: $10k

**Wife**

* Cash: $40k
* Non-registered: $20k
* RRSP: None
* TFSA: $20k
* FHSA: $20k

All of our ETFs are in low-cost S&P 500 and ex-US funds.

We have two cars: one is fully paid off, and the other is financed at $950 a month (we acknowledge this is quite expensive!).

**Current monthly expenses** (I've been generous here, and our non-fixed expenses aren’t actually this high):

* Mortgage and HOA: $4,000
* Eating out: $1,500
* Gas: $300
* Bills: $400

We save around $15k a month from our base salaries.

We are considering buying a 2-bedroom, 1-bath condo in Surrey/Coquitlam (maximum price of $550k) to diversify our investments and rent it out for $2,300-$2,500 to generate decent cash flow. We understand that we may not be cash positive in the first few years.

I plan to sell some of my company stocks and reinvest the proceeds into the down payment for the condo.

Does this sound like a good plan for diversification and investment purposes?",PersonalFinanceCanada,2024-11-27 22:37:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1h1fnsl/should_we_diversify_by_investing_in_a_condo_in/,0
"Morneau taking close look at return to 30-year insured mortgages, homebuilders’ association says","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-morneau-taking-close-look-at-return-to-30-year-insured-mortgages/

* * *

The federal government appears to be considering a budget announcement that would allow first-time homebuyers to obtain 30-year insured mortgages, up from the 25-year limit now, according to the Canadian Homebuilders’ Association.

Such a move would represent a change in direction after more than a decade of measures by federal Conservative and Liberal governments since the 2008 recession aimed at cooling housing markets and encouraging Canadians to take on smaller mortgages.

While the Bank of Canada continues to express concern about high household debt, politicians are also getting an earful from younger Canadians – a potentially key voting demographic – who can’t afford to enter the housing market.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s coming budget will be the government’s last before the scheduled October election. The minister recently said he is looking at home affordability issues for millennials, but he has not publicly speculated on potential policy options.

Over the past two weeks, top officials from the Prime Minister’s Office and Mr. Morneau’s office met with Kevin Lee, the chief executive of the Canadian Home Builders’ Association, to discuss potential budget measures.

Association spokesman David Foster said there is clear interest from government in the request put forward by housing industry groups to bring back 30-year insured mortgages.

“They keep wanting to talk with us about it, and it wouldn’t cost them a dime, so I’ve got to think those are somewhat positive signals,” Mr. Foster said on Wednesday.

The association discussed the matter earlier this week with Mr. Morneau’s chief of staff, Ben Chin. They also met last week with Sarah Hussaini, a policy adviser in the Prime Minister’s Office.

Pierre-Olivier Herbert, a spokesperson for Mr. Morneau, declined to comment, saying the office does not speculate on potential budget measures.

The association has had several meetings with officials and MPs over the past year in the run-up to the 2019 pre-election budget and recently narrowed down its wish list to just two items: a return to 30-year insured mortgages for first-time homebuyers and an easing of stress test measures that restrict access to non-insured mortgages.

Mr. Foster said officials are expressing interest in both options, but especially the 30-year mortgage proposal because it can be enacted unilaterally by the Finance Department. Changes to the stress test would require the co-operation of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, an independent regulator that just this week defended the existing rules.

MP Francesco Sorbara, who chairs a Liberal caucus on housing affordability issues that formed last year and is a member of the House of Commons finance committee, did not dismiss the 30-year mortgage proposal as a way of helping first-time homebuyers.

“It is one idea of many that is worthy of consideration, with the caveat that we maintain a secure and healthy housing market and that individuals are not overextending themselves,” he said.

Paul Taylor, president and CEO of Mortgage Professionals Canada, is also advocating for the 30-year mortgage option and said he was “encouraged” by Mr. Morneau’s recent comments about addressing affordability for millennials. However, Mr. Taylor said he has not received any indication from federal officials that a decision has been made.

The date of the budget has not yet been announced. The House of Commons only sits for one week in March, which makes the week of the 18th a likely window for the minister to deliver the budget. However, there is also speculation in Ottawa that the budget could be released in the final week of February.

Homebuyers with a down payment of at least 5 per cent of the purchase price but less than 20 per cent must be backed by mortgage insurance. This is offered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. – a Crown corporation – as well as two private insurers.

In 2008, after briefly allowing insured mortgages with a 40-year amortization period, then-Conservative finance minister Jim Flaherty reduced the maximum period to 35 years. The Conservative government lowered the maximum to 30 years in 2011 and acted again in 2012 to bring it to 25 years, where it has stood since. The moves were promoted as a way to prevent high-risk borrowing.

Shortly after the Liberals formed government in 2015, Mr. Morneau announced further mortgage tightening rules that December by doubling the size of the required down payment for insured mortgages for the portion of a home’s value from $500,000 to $1-million.

Mr. Foster, of the home builders’ association, said restricting insured 30-year mortgages to first-time homebuyers should prevent consumers from getting in over their head.

Millennials have most of their working years ahead of them and would likely pay off the mortgage sooner than 30 years, he said.

“We don’t think it involves any additional risk,” he said. “These are prime borrowers.”",PersonalFinanceCanada,2019-02-07 01:07:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/anxigw/morneau_taking_close_look_at_return_to_30year/,80
Shorting the housing market to hedge a home purchase,"Hey everyone, my wife and I are thinking about selling our starter home which has gone up 80% in value in less than a year and a half.

We do want to purchase a larger home but I am totally convinced at this point when rates start rising next year to combat inflation it will tank the market.  

Is there a good way to buy insurance for this, as in maybe for example buying puts on an ETF that tracks canada real estate?  If it doesn't crash I dont care if the puts expire worthless but I would prefer to get a big cash payout if the value of our house drops substantially if it does.

Thanks for your input in advance",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-12-04 14:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/r8q3a5/shorting_the_housing_market_to_hedge_a_home/,0
Estimating the budget for a family of 4 on arrival,"Hello everyone,

Sorry for the long post, I’ll try to be as accurate as possible.

I’m a recent PR through entry express with my wife and kid. I did what’s called a ‘soft landing’ in December where you basically come to Canada, get the PR and then you go back to your country before actually moving for good.  
Anyways, I’m moving to Canada with my wife and TWO kids in Jan 2025 and I have some questions that are related to.. Finance!

We make very good money but are not familiar with the Canadian financial system, hence my post.

The first point is: we will have around 300K CAD to bring with us, more or less, and we plan to have AT LEAST one of us in our couple to work as soon as we arrive (either by job transfer or by a job offer one of us would have accepted). Our salary range is all in all around 250K CAD per person/per year in our industry.

We will need to open a bank account in Canada, if you have recommendations for newcomers, please let me know.

Here are a few questions: 

1/ We plan on renting around Riverdale, Leslieville or The Beaches, I figured a furnished house around 5000$CAD per month maximum budget would be a balanced choice. When you rent in Canada, are there other spending I should be aware of? Let’s say I find a 5000$ CAD per month house on Zillow, are there hidden costs ?

  
2/ I plan on renting the house for a year to build my credit score and then buy a house, let’s say for the sake of calculation that I have a 300K CAD to bring to the table when buying a house, do you have any idea of the max house budget would be? Is it 1M ? 1.5? 

  
3/ I plan on buying or renting a car, but I’m trying to save as much as possible on this because I’m not really interested in cars. I just need a SUV to get the kids out and go on some road trips to discover the region: what would be the smart financial choice here? Buying a new car? Buying a used car? Renting a car? I was thinking 750 to 1000 cad per month MAX, including insurance would be more than enough, I’d like to know if it’s realistic and what are some smart options. Leasing can also be an option.

  
4/ I will have 2 kids, one will be almost 3yo and the other one under a year old. What is the school system for that age? Is it daycare for both? Any idea about what is a price per kid per month?  
I’m asking all this because I’m trying to budget our first year and understand the total amount that I need to spend on arrival.

  
Thank you all VERY much for reading and answering.

  
Looking forward to moving to your beautiful country.

Here are a few key points:

* Among Canadians under 35 who indicated that they were not experiencing financial difficulty, about one-quarter reported wanting to buy a home or move to a new rental but being unable to because of rising prices.
* Among those experiencing financial difficulty, 45% reported that they were unable to move because of rising prices, with 55% of renters reporting being unable to move.

BUYING a Home in your 20’s is Unrealistic?,"According to StatsCan, a 25-34 year old is averaging a $44,200 a year salary as of 2017. 

[StatsCan Source](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.4&pickMembers%5B2%5D=3.1&pickMembers%5B3%5D=4.1)

I currently live in Sask where the average home price is approximately $450,000. I know cities like Vancouver and Toronto are much more expensive than here. Saving up a 20% down payment would be $90,000 for the average Sask household. This would mean the average 25-34 year old Canadian saving 30% of their income would need to save for 7 YEARS! 

So is the only option for the average single millennial to live in a rural dwelling? Or put down a very small down payment? While house prices in urban cities have appreciated drastically, the average salaries haven’t increased at the same rate.

Just trying to wrap my head around a 20 something year old ever achieving this. Not at all complaining!

29 and trying to set myself up right,"I'm trying to build up a plan for my future, inflation and houses prices throwing everything off. Please give me your feedback.  

Currently I work at a bank in Ontario making 48k a year plus bonus which can be between 2-5k, this is after a raise I got recently as well. But with inflation and house prices I don't think this is enough. This is the most money I have ever made, before this job the most I made was about 30k. I'm starting to feel burn out so I'm trying to switch into a job with no sales. 

Limitations I have are health problems which would prevent me from doing a more physical job e.g factory or trades. My parents are elderly and have health problems and I cannot leave them, so I cannot move but can commute ideally less than 1 hour. I need to keep my work search a secret from my employer as they won't be too happy. Not even sure how to hide any potential interviews.  I've been looking at indeed but don't see good postings in my area.  I have a Bachelor in Liberal arts but would like to avoid more schooling.  

Currently I have saved 100k not including 20k I lent to my dad which he used to buy a house he will return the money when I need to buy a home. I'd like to buy a home by the time I am 35 at the latest. I have about 20k in stocks and the rest in a savings account and I chase promo offers too sometimes. 

Current expenses are $600 for rent and car insurance(living at home) $80 on 2 cell phone plans 1 for me 1 for my parents. $150 on gas a month. I have no debt paid off my school as soon my car broke down fixed it up, sold it and bought a newer used reliable car....hopefully lol. I also live at home because it is cheaper and my parents need help. 

 My savings goal at the start of the year was 12k plus whatever I get for bonus and contribute the max I can from stock matching which I think is around 4-6%At the rate I am saving at the end of the year I'll probably save 14k plus bonus.  

I don't really budget I could save more but I'm tired and worn out, I saved really well when I made little money and cut myself off from pleasures in life like eating out. When I saw housing prices skyrocket up it was very demoralizing. I'd consider leaving Ontario or going up North but can't due to family circumstances. My attitude currently is probably not very good but I'm loving eating out, having a night out with friends I think it is probably the only fun thing I have right now, dealing with my parents health problems which were unexpected and seeing my house purchase plans going up my smoke was very discouraging. I know I'll probably get roasted but let me know how I'm doing.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2022-11-02 19:49:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ykdfnr/29_and_trying_to_set_myself_up_right/,34

"Losing Family House - self-employment, old age, disability","Hello Everyone - thank you in advance for viewing this thread and providing any help that you can offer. I am very sorry that there is a lot of text here but I am trying to give as much useful information as I can. I am very worried and greatly appreciate any useful advice and thoughtful comments.

**TLDR:** I desperately need to come up with a solution for my family who is set to lose their rental home that they have been in for \~23 years. They live in a very small BC town (\~4000 ppl). My dad is currently self employed, my mom is not really able to work much anymore due to health and taking care of my grandma more and more over the past couple of years. My grandmother currently lives on her own in a small house that she owns, however she is 89 years old and we need to look at the best way to support her as she gets older and her health declines. I will give a summary on the current housing situation, the family members and assets, and what I am currently thinking about.

Financial summary:

* Parents income: \~ $50,000
* Parents rent: $750/month
* Parents assets: <$10,000
* Parents debt: 0
* &#x200B;
* Grandma income: estimated <$20,000
* Grandma assets: $350,000
* &#x200B;
* My income: $65,000
* My student debt: $32,000
* My assets (including car): $36,000
* Access to professional line of credit: another $20,000

Basically I am wondering if there are ways I do not know about to potentially get assistance for my mother, additional assistance for my grandmother, tax saving solutions for my dad, some mortgage scenarios that are feasible, what some smart options are for me to help.

**CURRENT HOUSING SITUATION:**

* **Parents:**
   * My mom and dad have lived in a rental home my entire life. They have been in the same house, a 1960's detached four bedroom house with an unfinished basement and .26 acre lot in a very small farming town in BC. Their rent when first moving in was $650 and it has only increased to $750 over the past 23 years (it has been $750 for the past 15 years. The rent in 1999 was above market rate, but it is now very much below the market rate due to the town becoming a hotspot for ""country living"" and retirement. The housing market has absolutely skyrocketed over the last two decades. For reference, two bedroom basement suites in their town are going for $1200-$1400.
   * My parents landlord has informed them that he would like to sell the house in the next 1.5 years and has told them that they have first dibs. The owner purchased the house in the 90's for around $95k. However, the house was assessed last year as being worth $258k, and the landlord is planning on listing the house for $440k. The landlord has said that he would count their rental history as a $50,000 contribution towards the purchase price of the house.

**Grandma:**

* She currently lives in a 1990's townhouse in a seniors strata community. It is a two bedroom plus den, with a finished basement, shared yard area and a single car garage. In the early 90' my grandpa passed away and my grandma liquidated all his assets to purchase this house in cash. The house is well maintained and quite nice but it is not very well suited for someone with increasing mobility issues. It is assessed at $275k - neighbouring units have sold this year for around $360k.

**PEOPLE PROFILES/EMPLOYMENT/ASSETS:**

**Dad:**

* My dad is 57 years old and has a BSc. in Kinesiology, a marketing diploma, a business/economic development diploma, and a diploma in renewable energy systems design and installation. He is in average health, aside from pretty regular middle aged guy stuff (high BMI, many old sports injuries, has had gall stones etc.
* My dad is a 1st gen canadian, his parents have passed away and he has no close siblings.
* For around 20 years he managed the economic development office until the job was dissolved. Since then he became the the BC sales manager for a renewable energy company that sells and installs batteries, solar and wind systems to consumers. He makes roughly $16/hour + 2.5% commission. They have obtained around $1,000,000 in sales so far this year, up from $300,000 last year (!). As a side note, dad's company is now dividing into seperate entities and he is being offered to purchase 10% of the company for $40,000, which includes I.P and existing BC Company assets (vehicles, software, electronics etc.).
* He has cleared his debt over the last few years luckily. However had student loan and credit card debt until 2017.
* He has no assets aside from a car ($6,000) and cash in a HISA (minimal).
* Safe to assume poor to average credit score.

**Mom:**

* My mom is 59 years old and has a BEd. for Elementary and a horticulture technician diploma. She is also an artist but is not actively selling art ( I think she probably could!).
* My mom's health is not very good. She has had ongoing issues with her thyroid for many years and overall is not in very good health. More pressingly, in her late twenties she had knee surgery on both her knees that did not go very well and have caused issues for her for the last 30+ years. She recieved regular injection therapy for around a decade before my dad was laid off and has had multiple subsequent surgeries. She has not been approved for knee replacement. This is relevant because she has difficulty being on her feet for more than 2 hours and can not comfortably drive.
* My mom is also a 1st gen canadian. My maternal grandma is the one mentioned. My mom has two siblings however they are not close and are not involved with my grandma.
* My mom was an full time elementary teacher before me and my older sister were born but has not had a full-time teaching job since then. I dont know why. Until around 2014, she would on average work 0.4 x FT throughout the school year. More young teachers moved to the community which were more desireable for the elementary school I guess. Until about 2010 she would work in a greenhouse from April to September but stopped when her leg pain became too much for the physical labour. In the last two to three years she has been taking care of my grandma more and more as she needs help driving to appointments, gardening and getting groceries etc.
* Same assests and debt scenario as my dad.

**Grandma:**

* She imigrated to Canada from Germany in the early 50's but is a Canadian citizen only (orphan of the war). She has no education.
* For all intents and purposes she is in good health for an 89 Year old (walks 10 km a week for example), but her age is catching up to her. She has advanced osteoporisis and in the last year or so has taken a couple falls, the most recent one landing her in the hospital for a few nights with three broken ribs. Additionally she is now quite deaf and she does have cataracts so she can't drive. She is showing some early signs of cognitive decline with memory which is why she needs more help recently.
* I know the inevitable question is what happens when she passes away. While I am biased because I am very close to my grandma, she is so stubborn and the toughest person I know so I honestly think that she will live to at least 100, if only to prove people wrong about her needing help.

**My older sister:**

* She is 29 and has a B.A in History and a B.A in English lit. She also has a diploma in tourism management and is currently in school to become a teacher (one apple doesnt fall far from either tree lmao).
* Has worked the last few months for government but will return to school in september.
* Has roughly $40k in student debt.
* No assets other than car ($8,000).
* Not really taking her into consideration to be honest.

**HOUSE OPTIONS:**

**FACTORS TO CONSIDER:**

* My grandma will not move into an old folks home. She is the most stubborn person I have ever met and has made this very clear (for example - she didnt even take advil when she broke her ribs because ""I have never taken drugs and I never will"").
* My parents won't move away from my grandma.
* They do not want to move to a city.
* Ideally will live in the BC interior the rest of their lives.
* Having a yard with space for a garden is most important factor in their living scenario for all of them.

Some starting thoughts for options below:

**1. Buying current house and grandma keeping her current house:**

* I think this is not a great option as my parents can't afford this mortgage on their own and there is no suitable income generating scenario with this option. The house is also do for quite a bit of general repair and renovation (roof, deck needs replacement, unfinished basement, one bathroom, very old appliances).
* The owner can obviously do whatever he wants but I do not think his offer to my parents is particularly great or ""generous"" as he was trying to convince my parents of.
* The house needs a considerable investment into improvements to be worth what he plans on selling it for (in my opinon).

**2. Selling my grandmas house, buying my parents current house:**

* As mentioned, my paretns house needs a lot of work and would need even more to have a suitable space for my grandma to move in. I estimate that the house would need $150,000 put into it at to make it suitable for my grandma and just improve the property. I could do a lot of the work myself but would still need to hire plumbers, electricians, framers, building inspectors etc. and I work 70 hours a week far away from them.
* Also inevitabley my mom siblings would not be okay with getting rid of my grandmas largest asset and it only benefitting my mom (even if she is far and away the most involved).

**3.** **Buying a old ""fixer-upper"" house/mobile home outside of city limits for a price my parents could get approved for themselves:**

* Possible option... but not ideal as my parents are not very DIY or handy so the house would only deteriorate.
* Would consider assisting them with downpayment if was on a nice parcel of land.

1. **Seeing if I can cosign a house with my parents to afford a nicer place:**

* Look into what mortgage I could be approved for as cosigning with my parents
* I can't afford to contribute to the mortgage per month while renting and paying off my debt., unless I could somehow use the home equity to absorb my student loan and thus contribute monthly to the mortgage.

**5.** **Selling my grandmas house and cosigning a house with my parents:**

* Could afford a place with a suite for my grandma, I would be fine with investing if possible into the right property (i.e good land value).
* Would definitely broaden the options
* Same issues as above re: my mom's siblings.

**6. Finding a property with land that could be sold from the property to assist my parents with the mortgage.**

Please ask for more information or anything that could help and thank you all again for looking at this post.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2021-07-08 00:47:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ofv75c/losing_family_house_selfemployment_old_age/,87
"Moving to London, ON. I have $100K cash, no family and guaranteed net monthly income of $5K for only two years with no prospects after... Should I buy or rent in London? Thinking of buying in better cities from a real-estate standpoint.","Thanks for your responses. Should I pay rent for two years, without building towards any sort of equity? Or should I buy, then -if I have to- sell in two years, or just rent it out? 

If I pay rent for two years, that's around 20K lost, to no equity.

Now if I buy a 1-bedroom for $100K, and let's say after two years it's valued at $105K (even though in London, it's predicted to increase 5% per year). So that $5K extra. Horrible I know, because I had to pay maintenance fees, property taxes, one-time transactions...etc. But, will that all add up to 25K , which would be an insane 25% of the price of the property? I'm here for anyone to convince me that yes, it would go up to 25K.

[Property tax in London](https://apps.london.ca/taxcalculator/default.html) for a $100K property would be a total of $2400 for these two years. Do the rest of the property ownership fees add up to $22K? I HIGHLY doubt it.

I'm seeing the [list of ""best Canadian Cities to buy a House in""](http://www.moneysense.ca/spend/real-estate/top-cities-canadian-real-estate-2017/), and now it makes a whole lot more sense to rent in London where I live, and buy in Guelph to rent out. Does that make any sense?

**Edit: Thanks guys... Yes, after adding in the condo fees, and everything else involved in the possible resale, it seems that renting and investing elsewhere is a better choice.**

I usually keep half what I saved in Betterment (50% stock 50% bond)... It increases 4%.... When I move back to Canada I'll be keeping 50K in a high interest savings account vs GIC, and 50K in whatever you guys advise here for that fluctuating 8-12%. everyone keeps talking about.",PersonalFinanceCanada,2017-12-31 15:04:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/7n8m4y/moving_to_london_on_i_have_100k_cash_no_family/,9
